                <p>i am new to this project, matter of fact i am on windows currently and i am preparing myself for my shift to linux. on windows i use throttlestop for my intel i7 10750h chip and i have undervolted it to 3.2GHZ. so i was exploring this project and was eyeing if it allows me to change the freq of each core. 

Thank you.</p>
