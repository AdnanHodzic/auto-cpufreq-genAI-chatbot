                <p>Apologies if this is already possible, but would it be possible to implement user configurable settings to have more aggressive CPU settings i.e. Higher sensitivity to load changes? I love auto-cpufreq but I would like a more aggressive CPU setting as my laptop still stutters sometimes with Gnome. Nothing against the tool, just my personal preference. It would be great to have this option.

Maybe it could be implemented by having 3 or 4 pre defined options to retain user friendliness? I look forward to hearing back. :) </p>
