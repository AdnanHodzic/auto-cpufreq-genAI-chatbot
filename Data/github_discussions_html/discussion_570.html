                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello @AdnanHodzic! I've been considering the idea of incorporating auto-cpufreq into open-source software events like [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) in the future. Given that the project has recently reached version 2.x, it seems like an opportune moment to invite a more extensive and diverse community to contribute.

Of course, such endeavors do come with some commitments. There might be a need to invest additional time in setting up the infrastructure for participation and reviewing incoming pull requests.

I'd like to propose this idea to you, as I believe it could foster greater collaboration and attract more contributors to auto-cpufreq. Your thoughts and insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!</p>

                    <p>Great idea and something that was on my ToDo as well. I registered as "maintainer" and topic `hacktoberfest` has been added to auto-cpufreq repo. So it's game on from my side ðŸ™‚

I encourage everyone who wants to participate as part of Hacktoberfest to add `hacktoberfest` label to their PR's. From my side all pull requests that I approve from this point on until end of month I'll add `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.

So please feel free to spread the word, I'll do the same.
