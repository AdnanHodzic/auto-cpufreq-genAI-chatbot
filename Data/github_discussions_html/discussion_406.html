                <p>NOTE: Dismiss, this, I reinstalled Kubuntu and it still doesn't show the power profiles, maybe it worked by chance once, I will investigate.

Original Message:
I have Kubuntu 22.04 and a laptop with an AMD 5800U, before installing auto-cpufreq from the snap package I could see the Power Profiles slider in the battery applet. I installed auto-cpufreq, uninstalled it (because I wanted to measure performance without auto-cpufreq) and now I cannot config the Power Profiles through the KDE battery applet anymore.</p>
