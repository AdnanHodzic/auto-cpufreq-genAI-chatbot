            <h1>FileNotFoundError when attempting install as daemon (EndeavourOS)</h1>
            <p><strong>Discussion #488</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>First of all; I'd like to start off by saying that I've seen mention that Arch-based distros might not be the easiest to install auto-cpufreq on. So if I've completely shot myself in the foot here, I'll own up to it.

As mentioned I'm on (a fresh and updated install of) EndeavourOS, Xfce4.

Monitoring the system works just fine, but when trying to deploy the persistent daemon using auto-cpufreq --install, I get the exact same error as [ssnailz over at the AUR discussion for this package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/auto-cpufreq#comment-899438). They posted their issue on the 27th of January but still haven't gotten any replies, so I thought I'd post the problem here, and get back to them if I get any help.

Here goes: 

```
--------------------- Deploying auto-cpufreq as a daemon ----------------------

* Turn off bluetooth on boot [skipping] (package providing bluetooth access is not present)

* Deploy auto-cpufreq install script

Any and all help is greatly appreciated!</p>
