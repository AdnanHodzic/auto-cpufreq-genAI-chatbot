                <p>Hi, 
I am new to the area of CPU frequency optimization so I have some beginner doubts. How does one choose the frequency bounds for the AC and battery modes. Is there a guide or resource to know about it (or is it trial and error?) and if it depends on the specifications of the laptop, how does one find these details?</p>
