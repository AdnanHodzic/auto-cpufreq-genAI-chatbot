                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I am looking for a _light weight_ solution to automatically change my cpu policy to "powersave" when on battery and "performance" when not on battery. I currently have a simple shell script that my root runs every minute with a single if statement to check if I am discharging and set the policy to lowpower, otherwise set the policy to performance.

For my rather simple use case, is this tool better than a cronjob and shell script? If so, what advantages does it provide?</p>

                    <p>I suggest you watch the [tool demo video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg&t=1s), or some of the [other youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=auto-cpufreq).

auto-cpufreq has multiple states based on which it'll change frequencies or governors to prologue battery life without compromising resources as also mentioned [on Readme](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#features). Not just switching states if it's plugged  in or not.</p>
