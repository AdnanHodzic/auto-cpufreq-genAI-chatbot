                <p>Hi,
I'm working on optimizing power consumption on my laptop.
I've been using auto-cpufreq for some time now.
In the README, it's said that it was not meant to run alongside TLP, so I'm not using it.
However, I'm wondering if I could benefit from using also powertop and thermald.

Could they work in tandem and benefit my battery life?</p>

I have `thermald` installed (it's installed as default on most distros nowadays). I also don't see why you should't use `powertop` to find ways to further optimize your battery life.

Sure, you can even use auto-cpufreq and TLP in tandem if you want, it's just that auto-cpufreq now has all the capabilities and it's not necessary to use TLP alongside it as mentioned in README.

                    <p>Cool, thanks!
So running `powertop --auto-tune` will be alright?</p>

                    <p>I don't know, for really long time now I only use `auto-cpufreq`, give it a try and report back :)</p>

                    <p>Updated README as part of ["Why do I need auto-cpufreq"](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/README.md#why-do-i-need-auto-cpufreq) about recommended use of `thermald` alongside auto-cpufreq.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic How long does the battery last just using auto-cpufreq?
