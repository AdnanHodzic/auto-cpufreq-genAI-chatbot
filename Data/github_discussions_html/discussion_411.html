                <p>It might sound strange but I'm using the 165Hz display and moving gradually from 40Hz, 60Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz 165Hz has enormous impact on the battery life. 

Hence the question/idea - would it be sensible to include some automatic screen refresh change to prevent battery drain? </p>
