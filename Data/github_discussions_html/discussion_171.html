                <p>Hey @crian @yochananmarqos @marc0der @librewish

Number 1 question that gets asked in every reported issue/bug is which `auto-cpufreq` are you running? I've decided to add this option as part of `--debug` flag. However, since I don't use Arch/Manjaro/Garuda, do you have any suggestions what's the best way to [output version of auto-cpufreq AUR if installed](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/auto-cpufreq-ver/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L71)? 

I pulled you in because I know you're using these, suggestions welcome! </p>

                    <p>Something like this? Probably needs some regex magic or something.
```
❯ pacman -Qi auto-cpufreq* | grep Version
Version         : 1.5.4.r4.gd062ca9-1
```</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Right, that's a good step forward. As this will output package version _if AUR package has been installed_. But currently it'll end up in this condition, if distros is detected as Arch based even package is not installed it will return back an error instead of package version.

It will also end up in this condition, if Arch based distro is detected even if user installed it using [auto-cpufreq-installer (source code)](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer).

Hence, I'm asking is there a good way to test "if AUR package (auto-cpufreq) has been installed" first.</p>

                    <p>Pacman only shows what it installed
It will not show if auto-cpufreq is installed via
Installer
So there is no need to worry</p>

                    <p>Right, to confirm. With logic that I have here, what will happen if Arch based user who installed auto-cpufreq using auto-cpufreq-installer (not pacman) runs `--debug`, [will you/he get output from git commit](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/auto-cpufreq-ver/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L74)?</p>

                    <p>Ended up installed Arch in VM to properly debug this problem, is part of [1.6.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

Thank you @yochananmarqos and @librewish for your input</p>

I'm seeing two issues here:
* attempting to query `pacman` for AUR package version when installed with `snap`
* the `pacman` binary does not seem accessible in this scope (probably due to running in snap)</p>
