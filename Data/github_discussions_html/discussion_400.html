                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I was referring to [this](https://github.com/deinstapel/cpupower). `cpupower` already utilizes the efficient frequencies based on the CPU's manufactured & rated hardware frequencies when idle.
Just wanted to know how auto-cpufreq works, compared to cpupower. I know a little bit about tlp, but not sure how auto-cpufreq is related to tlp.</p>
