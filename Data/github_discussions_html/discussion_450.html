                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I want to install [Peppermint Devaun edition](https://peppermintos.com/guide/downloading/) which uses systemV rather than systemD, so I wanted to enquire if this is supported by systemV as well without using some kind of wrapper, as I know that with Gnome applications you have to use some kind of wrapper to get systemV working with Gnome applications so that is why I ask?</p>

                    <p>There's already request for [Devuan support in issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/29).

Since I don't use it and am very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>
