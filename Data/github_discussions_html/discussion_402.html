            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>It used to set my min frequency to 600 mHz before. but alond with prolonged use it set to 400mHz and laptop has been slowing down too much. when on battery the cpu is underclocked so severely that whole functioning of the laptop slows down massively and the clock speed doesnt rise according to need and its stuck in 'powersaver' governer and 400gHz even when running intensive apps.

MY temperature issues while charging the laptop are:

Battery is: charging

Currently using: performance governor
Suggesting use of "performance" governor

Total CPU usage: 7.5 %
Total system load: 1.05
Average temp. of all cores: 50.75 °C 

High CPU load
suggesting to set turbo boost: on
Currently turbo boost is: off

Optimal total CPU usage: 10.2 %, high average core temp: 74.875 °C

Hope the problem is resolved asap and managed in better way. It worked just perfect a week ago now it is going all crazy by overheating while charging and lagging while on battery.
