It took a while figure out, but eventually I searched SMBIOS chassis types and I came across this specification document:
https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0134_3.2.0.pdf

On page 39, there is a list of possible chassis types. One example that I found odd is called "pizza box" and "lunch box." I have no idea how a computer chassis could be a "pizza box."

I'm trying to figure out which potential outputs are important and relevant and which are just weird things in the spec.
If we can determine which outputs need ac_state set manually to true, we can put everything else to "else." 

It's probably good to be thorough here as people have varying setups, and this piece of code could make our brake this daemon on each machine.

The solution me and Librewish created was a little quick and dirty. I foresaw this issue, but wanted to see if it would actually become an issue.
