                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have a NextCloudPi server that I want running as efficiently as possible and love the results on my laptops. 
Will this cause any issues on a Pi? I know that is now compatible with Arm. 

Thanks!</p>

                    <p>It should work just fine, I recommend you install and it first run it in ["monitor"](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#monitor) or ["live" ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#live)mode, if you're happy with results perform install. </p>
