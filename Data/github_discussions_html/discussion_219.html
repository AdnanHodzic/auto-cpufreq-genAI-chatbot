                <p>Is it possible to start a service on openrc? I tried sudo rc-service auto-cpufreq start and it says that it doesn't exist.</p>

                    <p>@los95 I'm pretty sure it can. I have no experience with openrc so I need help on how to identify if the system is using openrc. Output of:
- `readlink -f /sbin/init`
- `ps 1` and `ps h -o comm 1`

After that all we do is copy the service file to the corresponding directory. On runit service files are scripts, maybe on openrc as well?</p>
