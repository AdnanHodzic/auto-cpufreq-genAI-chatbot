On the readme, it was mentioned that aur-package has some problem, so i used https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer to install.

Now i am using --update flag but it is giving warning.</p>

                    <p>It was an known issue which has been fixed in #550. For now, you can clone and update auto-cpufreq using `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer`. Rest assured, if future updates arrives, they won't be hindered by that.</p>
