                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I had a look through the [default `/etc/tlp.conf`](https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/blob/main/tlp.conf.in) and found:

- Everything was commented out by default
- The defaults for all processor based settings looked like they were `<none>`, or disabled.

Can someone please confirm that, **by default**, there's nothing to do to prevent conflicts with `tlp`?</p>
