                <p>Hej, thanks for the amazing work! I was looking into auto-cpufreq since the early days, but the setup was a bit tedious compared to tlp/ppd. But since I am rocking NixOS now, things are different and I can try things out without a second thought!

I am big [Framework](https://frame.work) fan and I was rocking the OG 11th gen version and upgraded the motherboard to the 7840, worked so far like a charm! Buuut, I wanted to try out auto-cpufreq but the result isn't really great... The battery drain is really high... I was wondering if it is a similar issue on the 7040 series as with [TLP](https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/optimizing-ubuntu-battery-life-Sye_48Lg3):

## PPD (power-profiles-daemon) (****AMD****)

For Framework Laptop 13/16 AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series configurations, 
you will absolutely want to use power-profiles-daemon for the absolute best experience. 
*Do NOT use TLP*.
Without getting too detailed, there are things happening behind the scenes that require 
PPD for the best experience for our Linux customers.
```

I explicitly disabled tlp and ppd in the services section, so they don't colide with auto-cpufreq.

I am curious to hear about the experience of other users!</p>

                    <p>Hey, sorry for such delayed reply. 

Not sure what exactly seems to be the problem, as I don't have AMD hardware. My best suggestion would be to look through code and see could be going wrong.

Also try restarting auto-cpufreq systemd service to make sure all changes are picked up after you disable ppd and tlp. Would also suggest playing with [auto-cpufreq config file ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file)to see if you can make it work the way you want to.</p>
