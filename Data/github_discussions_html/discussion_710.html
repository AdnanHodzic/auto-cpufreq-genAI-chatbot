                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>If I execute acpi with auto-cpufeq off: (I  executed sudo auto-cpufreq --remove) I get: 
```Battery 0: Discharging, 24%, 01:12:46 remaining```
If I execute ```sudo auto-cpufreq --install``` and then acpi I get:
```Battery 0: Discharging, 24%, 00:37:47 remaining```
I have tested this multiple times and whenever I remove auto-cpufreq the battery life goes up and viceversa

I think it is interesting to note that ```tlp``` has the same effect. I haven't actually tested the battery life with a timer, but I do get the impression that I get less battery life with tlp/auto-cpufreq enabled.

                    <p>This definitely shouldn't be the case, have you tried using some of [the other drivers](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)? 

If problem persists, I would just consider opening an issue.</p>
