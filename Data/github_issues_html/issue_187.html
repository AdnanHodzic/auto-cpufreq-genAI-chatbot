                <p>This fixes a bug that causes the systemd service to go into a failed state because the `auto-cpufreq` script can't be found.</p>

                    <p>LGTM, but before we merge, can you confirm that you have the same (weird) problem. Namely if I install auto-cpufreq using the installer, and then install it and run:

```
auto-cpufreq --stats

Note: You can quit stats mode by pressing "ctrl+c"
```

I don't get anything else besides that. It works fine on Snap-ed installed of same source code. </p>

                    <p><strong>marc0der:</strong></p>
                    <p>I just installed it again from the `auto-cpufreq-installer` to make sure and it works perfectly for me.

Regarding the weirdness that you saw: the stats command initially does hang for 1 second but then renders fine without issues.</p>

Yea, it's just weird. Tried it on another laptop and no problems whatsoever.

Either way, thank you for your contribution! </p>

                    <p>On Fedora 34, I had to revert this commit for the tool to work. Otherwise, the stats command did not print any information.

```
which auto-cpufreq
/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq
```

I'm not sure if I'm missing something obvious here but running the installer script, then installing the service, leads to this non-working state.

Thanks for the great tool btw!</p>

Thank you for your input @theol0403!

@marc0der this confirms problem I was experiencing, please let me know if you have any additional input on this or how to resolve this issue, otherwise I'll have to revert this change. </p>

                    <p>I've had a further look, and it seems like there are some discrepancies in the distros as to where the files are copied to. The fix I did seems to work on Arch but breaks on other distros like Fedora.

I've now [raised a new PR](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/190) that reverts the change to the systemd unit file and customises it for Arch in the installer script.</p>

                    <p>@marc0der thanks! It works for me. 

Could @theol0403 you confirm #187 works for you as well? Changes are already live as part of [1.6.4 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.6.4).</p>
