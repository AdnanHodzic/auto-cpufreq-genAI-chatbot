I had used the Battery Config for my T480. Currently it doesn't have a external battery and only the internal battery. The configuration I added to /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf are as follows:

[battery]
enable_thresholds = true
start_threshold = 20
stop_threshold = 90 

When I would reboot the system with a charge below 90% it would not charge only indicating "Not Charging". I had to restart the battery using the methods in https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T-series-Laptops/T480-plugged-in-not-charging-Solution/m-p/5049970 in order to restarting charging again. I repeated this command shortly after and rebooted the system and the same symptoms showed and repeated the battery reboot in order to get it charging again. 

*Note: in the .conf file that is the only lines I added to the .conf file. When I opened the .conf file it was blank.
