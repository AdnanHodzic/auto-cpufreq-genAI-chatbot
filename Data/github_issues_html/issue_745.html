            <h1>Fix: Getting incorrect max frequency value</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #745</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This PR (partially) closes https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/737. Instead of getting the max frequency from `cpuinfo_max_freq`, it gets from `scaling_max_freq`. It shoudn't be a problem for most systems, since these values tend to be the same. However, on some cases(like https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/737), they are reported different, with the `scaling_max_freq` being the correct one. Apparently this can happen if turbo boost is enabled by means other than the bios , like writing to the cpu registers directly or editing `/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo`

Any feedback about potential problems or improvements would be greatly appreciated.</p>
