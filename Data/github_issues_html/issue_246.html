            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Trying not to use snap for this as it actually consumes more power to use it. The installer runs without error but it will not start when run with sudo.

                    <p>Could you install it using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store)? As it runs in a container and isolates its Python env from your env. 

Also with [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>

                    <p>As I initially wrote, I'm trying not to use Snap as it consumes additional power, negating the use of auto-cpufreq. As such, I have stopped using it (and Snap, for that matter).</p>

                    <p>> Snap as it consumes additional power, negating the use of auto-cpufreq. 

I'm sorry but this statement is just not true. There's no difference in battery life between using snap and regular auto-cpufreq, even if there is small that it's negligible. This is the first time I actually heard from anybody that it makes such a drastic difference. However, if this really is the case for you, I would suggest reporting this problem on [Snapcraft forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/) and see where it goes from there.

Of course, I don't want to force you to use certain software, I'm just saying that people who reported this same issue didn't have it with snap package, i.e: #212 </p>

                    <p>I'm just working from what powertop reports. I realize it's an estimate, but it reported using well over a watt use and with the battery capacity of the laptop I'm using this on, that's an amount I can't sacrifice.

For the record, it did work with the Snap package, but I found that tuned works just as well and doesn't require Snap.</p>
