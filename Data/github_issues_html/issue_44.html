                    <p>IMO the best way to handle this would be to make code changes to detect if TLP is installed and running. After `auto-cpufreq` install, instruct user they should add these changes. If you want please open a new issue and name it "[feature request] TLP detection and instruction" and I'll look at with I have time.

Otherwise, you can give it a try yourself :)

Other way would be to extend README and I'm not big fan of doing this.</p>

Seems reasonable.
I'll try to implement, doesn't look challenging.
Closing the PR.</p>

                    <p>@validatedev sounds good! Looking forward to your PR and once you have it please give me rights to also make changes if necessary.</p>
