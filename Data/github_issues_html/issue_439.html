                <p>Hi Adnan,
I have an issue running auto-cpufreq with kernel at `5.18.10-76051810-generic` (Pop os). This is something new - the tool was working fine before the upgrade. Sadly I can't tell which exact linux version I used to use before.
I've tried reinstalling the package with snap but it didn't help. Running auto-cpufreq always results in the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq", line 4, in <module>
    __import__('pkg_resources').run_script('auto-cpufreq==1.9.3+ae1f53c7', 'auto-cpufreq')
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
```

Tried running it with `--stats`, `--version` and `--help` - same result regardless of the argument.

I'm running the latest (1.9.6) version - `snap list` resulted in the following output
```
Name          Version   Rev    Tracking       Publisher   Notes
auto-cpufreq  1.9.6     122    latest/stable  fooctrl     -
```

I might come up with a PR fixing this but first, could somebody confirm the same error? This might also be issue with my local setup...

Kernel version has nothing to do with this.

This looks like you're running old version of `auto-cpufreq==1.9.3+ae1f53c7`. 

> I'm running the latest (1.9.6) version - snap list resulted in the following output

I can't figure out if you installed using [installer or snap package,](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#installing-auto-cpufreq) (or you have both at the same time?) since you didn't fill out the template when reporting this issue. But with snap package you shouldn't run into these type of errors since it packages all the dependencies into a container.

That would be great and please do so, but I think this might related to your own setup, and next time please fill out the template issue as without it I usually close the issues, reference:

### Fill out informtion requested in this template, without doing so issue will be ignored & closed!

What I did after encountering the problem initially was I uninstalled the package and install it again using `snap`. As I showed, the installed version was `1.9.6` - according to `snap list` output.</p>

Let me know if following message can be improved in any way:

What's the error you get if you only have it installed as snap package (1.9.6)? Before that, make sure to run `sudo snap refresh auto-cpufreq` first.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>matkob:</strong></p>
                    <p>I ran couple of commands to clean the state and make it as reproducible as possible:

1. Ran `sudo snap refresh auto-cpufreq` which resulted in `snap "auto-cpufreq" has no updates available`
2. Ran `sudo snap remove auto-cpufreq` and `sudo snap install auto-cpufreq` which resulted in `auto-cpufreq 1.9.6 from Adnan Hodzic (fooctrl) installed`
3. Ran `auto-cpufreq --debug` and the error was the same:

```

```
What's interesting is that installing the tool via script seems to be working just fine. Using snap is problematic though</p>

Indeed, this is very strange. My hunch is that PopOS is doing something different and that certain package might be missing from [python-packages dep. section for Snap](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L21) which might be needed for PopOS. Which if added would fix this issue, I know in past there weresimiliar issues on Fedora and Snap packages, but it was all fixed.

Either way, that's why auto-cpufreq-installer is there, in case Snap install fails and vice versa.

However, what's even stranger in all of this is:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq", line 4, in <module>
    __import__('pkg_resources').run_script('auto-cpufreq==1.9.3+ae1f53c7', 'auto-cpufreq')
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
```

In particular `auto-cpufreq==1.9.3+ae1f53c7` as that's an obviously old version with git tag which gets added when using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer). Same will be reported as part of `sudo auto-cpufreq --debug`, i.e: `auto-cpufreq version: 1.9.6 (git: e813301a)`</p>

                    <p>I propose to close this issue as installing the tool via installer worked and I won't have enough time to debug what happened exactly.

Thanks for your input anyway, hope it was just local setup related.</p>
