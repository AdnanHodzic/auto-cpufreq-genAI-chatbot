Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behavior.
Daemon running in /opt/auto-cpufreq has very high cpu usage(10-12%) consistently when running. Doesn't seem like normal behavior. Any solutions?

Yes, just retried the troubleshootings tips and they make no difference. However I tried reinstalling and recieved this message which I didn't notice the first time installing :`warning: auto-cpufreq: unable to open supervise/ok: file does not exist
warning: auto-cpufreq: unable to open supervise/ok: file does not exist
`
which may be useful in debugging this issue.</p>

                    <p>i am on void linux too, and the service provided by auto-cpufreq installer for runit doesn't work, it constantly crashes. However, when I run "sudo auto-cpufreq --daemon" everything works just fine.</p>

                    <p>Just doing `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin` solves that, in the run file of the service before exec.</p>
