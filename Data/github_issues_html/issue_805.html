                    <p>Well that's the problem, [in this code block line](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto-cpufreq-installer#L102):

```

Every mention of `python38` should be updated to latest python version for Suse (*seems like it's just `python3`). As now it's trying to install old Python version that's not even there. 

Update this string and give it a try, make these changes and re-install `sudo auto-cpufreq-installer --install`  followed by `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` and it should all work fine. If it all works as expected please create a PR and ([contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

     There was python38 updating it to python3 & also python3-setuptools were being mapped to some older version of the utility causing the install to fail updating it to python311-setuptools fixed it.</p>
