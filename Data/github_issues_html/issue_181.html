Hello, I can't activate auto-cpufreq systemd daemon on opensuse. I never had this issue on other distros. The service is failing with the following status:

● auto-cpufreq.service - auto-cpufreq - Automatic CPU speed & power optimizer for Linux
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/auto-cpufreq.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

@koushikkhan seems to not have the auto-cpufreq binary in the /usr/local/bin folder, so I guess setup.py has not copied correctly the file. 
One thing you @koushikkhan can try to fix your problem is searching for `auto-cpufreq` with `find / -iname 'auto-cpufreq'` and see whether and where that file is, and then modify the service file accordingly</p>
