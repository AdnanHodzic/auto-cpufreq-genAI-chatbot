Not a single auto-cpufreq command is working and I'm not sure why. Setuptools exists and i've tried to reinstall it. I'm using the git aur package at the moment</p>

                    <p>I have exact same problem. Suddenly I found out that my frequencies are a bit too high on battery, so I wanted to check what's going on. Turns out I have the same problem. Auto-cpufreq is not working, every command ends up with exact same error. I have all pip packages upgraded to latest versions, including setuptools.</p>

                    <p>I've had the same issue. I fixed it by changing `sys.path.append("../")` to `sys.path.append("/path/to/auto-cpufreq/")` in `auto-cpufreq/bin/auto-coufreq` and then reinstalled it. I hope this helps. </p>

                    <p>@conrad-mo you haven't filled out issue template, i.e:

_If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?_

So I have no idea if this is happening on installation with Snap package or auto-cpufreq-installer? 

@aallliiikk I'd encourage you to make these changes as part of a PR and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

                    <p>I had the same issue, using the auto-cpufreq-installer script after cloning this repository.

`git pull && sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer && systemctl restart auto-cpufreq` seems to have fixed this issue</p>
