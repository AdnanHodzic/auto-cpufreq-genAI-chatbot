            <h1>CPU Frequency on battery power very low on a Intel 12gen </h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #660</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Replaced the Intel Pstate driver, as can be seen below.
I always get :
CPU max frequency: 2501 MHz
CPU min frequency: 400 MHz
regardless of settings in  /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf
While on AC power, the system works as expected.
On battery power the CPU never gets above 2500Mhz, even though the temp is below 40 degrees.
On AC they reach 4400Mhz.

```

Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file

Note: You can quit stats mode by pressing "ctrl+c"
Configuration file enforces turbo boost
setting turbo boost: on

                    <p>After a day of attempts, switched the driver with  intel_pstate=disable , disabled C0 CPU halts with idle=poll in grub, tweaked  /dev/cpu_dma_latency and etc brought no improvement.
Intalled portable windows 10 and compared. The performance loss in battery mode seems similar, though on Windows the CPU drops to about 3200Mhz, while on Linux I get 2800Mhz max.
Performance reported by "7z b" is about 20% better in windows 10 than Ubuntu 22.04.
So there seems to be some minor possibility for improvement....</p>

                    <p>Seems the laptop is restricted by the manufacturer to no more than 15Watt while on battery. Played with ```throttlestop``` under windows and ```throttled``` undel linux.
Under windows  I can keep constant 16Watt and 26000 performance rating of ```7z b```
Under linux the I barely reach 10W and 15000 performance rating. Use this to monitor ```sudo turbostat --Summary --quiet --show Busy%,Bzy_MHz,IRQ,PkgWatt,PkgTmp,GFXWatt,CorWatt --interval 6```
Seems there is some issue under Linux, same hardware is twice slower.</p>

                    <p>Closing the issue due to inactivity as it seems unrelated to auto-cpufreq.</p>
