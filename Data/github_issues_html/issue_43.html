                    <p>@crian is the maintainer of AUR package, so could you please both give us an update? Also, I remember somewhere you mentioned it would be good if there were releases, now [there are as I released v1.0](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/1.0).

@Wrizz until there's an update to AUR package, I'd suggest you to use [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#installing-auto-cpufreq) and please inform me if you get any issues.

I also released [ `auto-cpufreq` to Snap store.](https://snapcraft.io/auto-cpufreq/) But since I see latest version of [snapd in AUR is 2.43](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snapd/), and as [I stated for full functionality](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store) `auto-cpufreq` needs snapd version 2.4.4 which is currently only available in Ubuntu 20.04.</p>

                    <p>@crian great, thank you!

@Wrizz please retry by installing latest version of [auto-cpufreq AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=nd&K=auto-cpufreq&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go).</p>
