            <h1>Refactroring and amd support</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #67</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>fixes #17

- Added get_avail_powersave() (and performance).
  This function returns the most energy(and performance) efficient governor.
  This should fix AMD issue when powersave is not available
  but "ondemand" or "schedutil" are present

- Cleaned up and refactored.
  Added more convenient util functions.
  Also made it more pythonic, reduced subprocess calls, made it more modular

- Added support for setting turbo boost for AMD and Intel (intel_pstate and cpufreq driver)

- Tested on Intel and AMD machines and it works fine
    - It at least doesn't  fail
    - performance/powersave is switching correct
    - turbo is switching correct on high CPU load.

- It needs more testing</p>

While everything works great with `auto-cpufreq-installer` and `auto-cpufreq` works as expected on Intel. When I create a snap out of these changes I run into following error:

```

Hence, I'm trying to figure out what this is about exactly before I merge this with master.</p>

                    <p>Yeah, this is exact problem happens on POP OS
Didn't u have such a problem on a master?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>Yeah, want to get it merged, than want to start implementing config file</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Let's get this merged, this stuff is to good not to be part of master :) 

In meantime I'll deal with snap build problem, seems like something changed in snapd which I wasn't aware of.</p>
