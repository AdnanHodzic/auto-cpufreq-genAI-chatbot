- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)? I used the AUR

- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)? It's not related, the program and the cli works fine

### Error output:
```text
Add/paste error output in case of failed installation or other failing component
```
That's the interesting part, there's no output, auto-cpufreq-gtk just doesn't launch with exit code 1

Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

The program and the cli interface works fine, thank you for your work, but the GUI doesn't launch, I've gotten it to launch through the terminal using  "env -i XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS auto-cpufreq-gtk" (suggested by chatgpt) but I don't know why it doesn't without it. Maybe because I'm using wayland?

Good to hear, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

It would be great to have these changes as part of `master` branch.</p>
