            <h1>CPU not scaling up</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #393</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Ive just installed this and ran it in live mode, it sets the system to run at most 1400Mhz, even under full load, ive used the power_save.py script to attempt to get it to run in anymore than power save. It does allow boosting but the cpu will never boost, nor does it change governor from powersave to balanced or performace

If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer)have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?</p>

                    <p>Through further testing I have found that even when using the config file, it will not change governor, always stuck in powersave

                    <p>~~Hello, I can report something similar. Yesterday night I got `auto-cpufreq` to work, and it did improve performance. I installed it via the AUR package and enabled it with the `sudo systemctl enable auto-cpufreq`, then rebooted. Everything worked fine and the performance optimization was _notable_. Today, when I opened my laptop I noticed the same thing. It was lagging because the CPU was not scaling up and was locked to 500Mhz (CPU: Intel Celeron N2840). I had to manually disable the service manually (with `sudo systemctl disable auto-cpufreq`). Please fix that, `auto-cpufreq` brings my old laptop back to life, but with this problem it makes it function even worse :(~~
I'm transferring this to #398 because it is related to that..</p>
