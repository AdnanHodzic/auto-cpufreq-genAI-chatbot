                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have tried both intel_pstate and acpi-cpufreq drivers.  In both cases I cannot go below 800 MHz. 

Is this normal?  The machine is a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th, Intel i7 8550u.

Minimum frequency proposted fron auto-cpufreq is 400 MHz.</p>

Since you didn't include `auto-cpufreq --debug`, this issue should've been ignored as I don't know what auto-cpufeq proposed.

Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)? As you can always configure it yourself if you're not happy how auto-cpufreq does things automatically.

Why wouldn't it be "normal"? For my CPU auto-cpufreq also proposes `CPU min frequency: 400 MHz` but I rarely/never see it go under 800Mhz, do I see that as a problem? No.

I'm closing this as this is not an issue and is more of a question which should be in [Discussions](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions).</p>
