### Have you tried?

- [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 
- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?
- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?
- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?

### Error output:
i noticed anytime i turn my laptop on from sleep while connected to ac the cpu frequency caps at 1.8ghz when auto-cpufreq config is set to 2.9ghz max and min.  i have to unplug the charger then plug it back in for the cpu to go up to 2.9ghz.

                    <p>> unable to reproduce on GNOME 44.4

im using ubuntu which has GNOME 42.9
it happens each time it resumes from sleep, the cpu speed stays capped at 1.8ghz until i connect it to ac then it operates using the config i set</p>

this is my config file

iv disabled the scaling min/max freq atm, it seems to work fine when disabled but i would like to have it at max speed always while connected to ac

this is the debug output

                    <p>I'm still unable to reproduce this after using your config file. The only difference I see is our GNOME versions. I use NixOS which is on v44.4 which is not on Ubuntu LTS yet. As far as I can tell, this is not an issue with auto-cpufreq</p>

im thinking the same too, i tried using the config again, put the pc to sleep, turned it on and this is the debug readings
