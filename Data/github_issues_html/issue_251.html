                <p>
CPU frequency it's not scaling properly.
I installed the tool from the AUR. I've tried changing intel driver from GRUB but it still says `intel_pstate` and not scaling.

                    <p>With [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hi there,
after toggling some settings in the UEFI the driver now is 'acpi-cpufreq'.
'--stats' is showing that my CPU cores in "powersave" are capped at 400MHz (min) except for one core (~1000MHz) but cpupower-gui is showing that all cores are running at >~1000MHz. Am I doing something wrong? </p>

Could you please upgrade to [v1.7.1 ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases)which was just released and report back if you still have the same problem? As one of the issues that was related to powersave mode. 

If settings aren't picked up right automatically, I'd encourage you to [set these settings](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) to your liking. </p>

Once you put a config file to `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf'`, you don't have to do anything, then just run `auto-cpufreq` and it'll be automatically picked up.

But from your output above it seems like `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` is being run instead.</p>

                    <p>Just [released v1.9.2](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which adds ability to change power governor used by default with auto-cpufreq from `balanced` to `performance` [using power_helper.py script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script) which could also resolve this problem.
