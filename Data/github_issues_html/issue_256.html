                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I think it would be really useful to test auto-cpufreq on a set of (system state, config, expected action) tuples. This would help to check cases like https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/255. `core.py` could be refactored to expose an easy-to-test API like
```python
state = get_system_state()
action = get_action(state, config)
execute(action)
```</p>
            </div>
