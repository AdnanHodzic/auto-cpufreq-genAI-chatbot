                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When trying to install auto-cpufreq in Fedora 39, I got the following error: 

> Detected Git repository, but failed because of dubious ownership

Adding the line at the top of the install function according to https://sam.hooke.me/note/2023/08/poetry-fixing-dubious-ownership-error/ solved the error for me.</p>
