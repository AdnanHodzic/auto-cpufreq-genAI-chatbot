### Have you tried?

- [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 

Yes, I have found multiple issues but they claim that it has been resolved.

**EDIT**: I have possibly duplicated https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/724, I'm sorry if that's the case, I should have been more careful. Specifically:

> When the governor is set to performance, only performance EPP is available as you can see in the screenshot below. By default auto-cpufreq tries to set balance-performance which might be causing this issue because such an EPP is not available.

- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?

Not failed.

- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?

Yes.

- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?

I checked, but the issue is not listed.

### Error output:

Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

Line 98 is:

```shell
function write_value () {
  if [ -w $FLNM ]; then echo $VALUE > $FLNM; fi
}
```

This only happens with performance governor. Switching to powersave doesn't give any error. Charger plugged in or not makes no difference.

**EDIT**: I have possibly duplicated https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/724, I'm sorry if that's the case, I should have been more careful. Specifically:

> When the governor is set to performance, only performance EPP is available as you can see in the screenshot below. By default auto-cpufreq tries to set balance-performance which might be causing this issue because such an EPP is not available.

I'm on Arch Linux on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H CPU, and I still get this error when in charging mode.

Exact error:
```
