                <p>Dependencies is always a hell. While snap solves that problem, it's an additional 109MB to download and install, just to use this python script. An overkill.

My request would be to list all the python dependencies along with the versions this tool is guaranteed to work with. 

So far I had to pip-upgrade a `click` library, and still, I'm getting errors. Probably some other dependency is outdated...</p>

                    <p>nvm, I got confused by the multi-stage install process: ./bin/auto-cpufreq --install and sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer - didn't realize these two were different things</p>
