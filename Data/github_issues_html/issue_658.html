### Error
After disabling intel_pstate system doesn't boot, Seems just stuck at showing vendor logo.
After reverting the changes of `/etc/default/grub` it boots normally again:
This is my `grub` file:
```
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_pstate=disable resume=UUID=75014eab-9c4f-4920-a93c-a146720c5adc"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

```

Tried removing  `resume=UUID=75014eab-9c4f-4920-a93c-a146720c5adc`, But it's the same.
After removing `intel_pstate=disable ` and executing `update-grub`  through the recovery-mode system booted system normally.

                    <p>This isn't really an auto-cpufreq issue. But make sure you have the following packages installed using:

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install acpi-support acpid acpi
```</p>
                </div>

                    <p>> sudo apt-get install acpi-support acpid acpi

`E: Unable to locate package acpi-support`
But installed `acpid` and `acpi`. 
Still the same

>The package named acpi-support is not available in Ubuntu 23.10 or any recent versions of Ubuntu. The functionalities previously offered by acpi-support are now integrated into the kernel itself. This means you don't need to install any separate package for ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Management) support.

                    <p>Definitely not normal behavior. Maybe because it's a Huawei laptop. Personally, I didn't even know they made laptops.

I would check your bios for any relevant settings. It might just be the firmware</p>

In your bios, look for settings related to dynamic CPU frequency or P-states</p>

I don't actually know what signs to look for, I'm a newbie on Linux.
Can you suggest something? maybe something to learn.

These are all options in my bios:

I have disabled intel_pstate by replacing `intel_pstate=disable` with `intel_pstate=passive` .

But now system are so slow on battery. UI lags so much, almost unusable.
Any solution?

That means you have *enabled* intel_pstate

> But now system are so slow on battery

This is likely because of how intel_pstate handles the powersave governor
You can change to using a different governor on battery by using a config file. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file) in the README
