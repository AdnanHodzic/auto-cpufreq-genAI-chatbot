                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The documentation for auto-cpufreq was very confusing, sometimes with conflicting information. Hopefully, I've managed to clear things up a bit :D</p>

Thanks for the recommendations, I have gone through them and committed them. I also took the liberty of adding an index and fixing some broken links.

Let me know if there is anything to add or remove :)</p>
