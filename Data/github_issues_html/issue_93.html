            <h1>Hard system lockup</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #93</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I was not able to retrieve any logs since the system completely locked up. I could not using the magic SysRq key combo and had to hold the power button to turn my laptop off. I also use TLP if that makes a difference.

Another member of the Manjaro team has an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H and experienced the same issue. He said, 

> My laptop just locked up while spewing thousands of lines of hexdump into the kernel log.

I asked him to open an issue since he maybe had a log to share, but since he hasn't I figured I would. I'll let him know I opened the issue and perhaps he'll chime in.

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I have no any idea why changing governor and turbo can cause lockup (is that just freezing or kernel panic, because it's not clear for me what does lockup mean)</p>

                    <p>That's a very good point @Red-Eyed 

@yochananmarqos could you please further elaborate on what exactly do you mean by "lockup" in this scenario? Thanks</p>

                    <p>Lockup as in frozen solid with no response to input.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm closing this issue because I don't think it's related to auto-cpufreq. As I'm not sure under which condition this would happen, I'm more inclined to believe this is related to potential TLP misconfiguration. 

Try disabling it and see if you get this problem when only running with auto-cpufreq. Although from my experience auto-cpufreq works great in conjunction with TLP.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>yochananmarqos:</strong></p>
                    <p>It is indeed related, but there's no logs I can find. A lockup like that doesn't record anything since it freezes solid. I have to hold the power button to restart. I just reproduced it on the same laptop, a Dell Inspiron 5575 with a Ryzen 5 2500U. 

However, there is good news. I'm having no issues on my new System76 Serval WS with a Ryzen 7 3700X.</p>
