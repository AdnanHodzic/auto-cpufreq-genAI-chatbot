                <p>Run Script (Could be replaceable by auto-cpufreq-r6 runscript )

And a sysvinit daemon for auto-cpufreq generated THANKS TO :- 

https://github.com/yunginnanet/sysvinit-service-generator fork of https://github.com/wyhasany/sysvinit-service-generator

It should be inside /etc/init.d/</p>

                    <p>LGTM, but the part which I'm missing is how will the [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto-cpufreq-installer) detect if system user is running on is running on systemv and it's not refering to [install script anywhre](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh)?

Or was there other you were envisioning of working?</p>

:+1:, but this part is still missing:

> Also to repeat what Adnan suggested, the [daemon installer script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh#L71C25-L71C25) should be updated to include this new sysvinit service. The problem I see is what we already support openrc which uses sysvinit by default, so they both use the `init` process name for PID 1, so we need a way to distinguish the difference.
> 
> Something like this could work:
> 
> ```shell
> # snippet
> elif [ "$(ps h -o comm 1)" = "init" ];then
>     # Check if /etc/inittab file exists
>     if [ -e "/etc/inittab" ]; then
>        # sysvinit command here
>     else
>         # openrc stuff moved here
>     fi
> ```
> 
> Additionally, the same change should be made to the [daemon removal script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/auto-cpufreq-remove.sh#L55). If that doesn't make sense, please let me know and also feel free to comment if you have any alternative ideas since I am not as familiar with openrc or sysvinit :)

For reference see how in [daemon installer script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh#L71C25-L71C25) it was done for `# Install script for openrc` or `# Install script for systemd` and refer to @shadeyg56 comment above.</p>

I Edited openrc script to be like that and I used this fedora resource in this link that helped me find sysvinit commands https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SysVinit_to_Systemd_Cheatsheet

For now I didn't test the code

                    <p>I am testing this right now on MX linux 23 Fluxbox 64 bit edition (non systemd) and would like to post my observations from discord (sry for the ad-hoc writing style):

Mh, it seems to work, installation went good, when i started in monitor mode it reminded me to de-install tlp, I did that restarted, now I'm running in live mode, the temperatures are the same with a different monitoring tool, unplugging the power supply gets detected, the setting to use governor is the same like in cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor   from another terminal. The testing laptop is fairly old: Not setting EPP (Not supported by system)  Warning: CPU turbo is not available seem plausible.

However, I get "System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1 ). Can't operate. Failed to connect to bus: PC is not active .... " when starting live or monitor mode, but I ignored that for now.

I see, I have to check if I get it installed permanently.

There seems to be a problem in line 84 at the auto-cpufreq-install script:

echo -e "\n* "Enabling auto-cpufreq daemon (sysvinit) service at boot"
    chkconfig auto-cpufreq-sysvinit on
    
 when running 
 
 sudo auto-cpufreq -- install

   * Turn off bluetooth on boot

   * Deploy auto-cpufreq install script

    * Deplo auto-cpufreq*remove script

There was a problem, couldn't determine GNOME Power Profiles Daemon 

-----------------Running auto-cpufreq daemon install script -------------------------

                    <p>Ok it seems that chkconfig command is deprecated years ago and we should use insteasd sysv-rc-conf it can be found in debian repos https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/sysv-rc-conf

                    <p>Alrighty, there are some errors I want to post here besides chkconfig, you might have come across them in your virtual machine:

when running auto-cpufreq --install    (with the changes from above)

I also get these three errors:

mkdir: cannot create folder : "/etc/inittab": file exists already

* Reloading sysvinit manager configuration
auto-cpufreq: unrecognized service

* starting auto-cpufreq daemon (ssvinit) service
auto-cpufreq: unrecognized service

                    <p>Just for a heads up: as written in the review  the copying when running auto-cpufreq --install seems to work now. When adding chmod +x /etc/init.d/auto-cpufreq and restart the os the shell script runs as a system service at reboot. But when running auto-cpufreq --stats the daemon doesn't seem to be active. I think it's close to working but sadly I am no expert at all. I guess the sysvinit script needs some revisit and maybe the things pointed out by [shadeyg56](https://github.com/shadeyg56) regarding the daemon removal script. Maybe [shadeyg56](https://github.com/shadeyg56)  can take a look at the state right now?   </p>

                    <p>As written above I think it's not quite there yet, at least on my machine the auto-cpufreq daemon isn't active. The init system script gets started however (after the suggested changes).</p>

                    <p>Haven't been able to test in a VM since `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` does not work in VMs so the OS would need to be installed natively. @AmerXz have you tested the changes?</p>

Hi, I'm looking to use auto-cpufreq with MX-Linux as well but I still got the same error message in your earlier posts:
*System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.

how did you manage to get it work with MX-Linux and sysvinit system? would love to learn more to get this working.
or is this still undergoing tests? I notice the status is WIP.
Thanks for the great tool !</p>

                    <p>IIRC @Angel-Karasu recently made some changes to make auto-cpufreq work with MX Linux?

Regardless, @AmerXz if this is anywhere close to merging (if it works) maybe it's good idea to start the review/merge process?</p>
