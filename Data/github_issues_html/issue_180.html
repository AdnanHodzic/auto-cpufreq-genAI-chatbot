                    <p>Hi!

On Fedora 33, using installer and git source, everything seems to be installed correctly if i trust terminal, but commands fails 
I read same issue with snap package on Fedora.

Note that snapd install works fine, but i prefer not to use Snap wich enables a new service and downloads hundreds of Mo.

Any idea? Thanks a lot!

                    <p>Hi Ugo,

Yes, this is a known issue on Fedora & Snap package, please see second paragraph of "Please note" section for Fedora users as part of [Installing auto-cpufreq from Snap store](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store).

Since it's a known issue and there's no permanent solution for it now, I'll close the issue, feel free to re-open it if this doesn't solve your problem.</p>

                    <p>Thanks Adnan.

But on l'y Fedora this trouble appears with installer script, not with Snap.</p>

                    <p>You install auto-cpufreq with auto-cpufreq-installer and you run it and you get `bash: auto-cpufreq: command not found...`?

Can you provide `auto-cpufreq --debug` output?</p>

                    <p>Thanks a lot for spending time for me and for the Linux community!

I tried again after yesterday fails and - do not know why cause i used same commands in shell using terminal memory - 
 TADAM! Today everything runs fine (except ctrl-c in terminal but i do not mind)

Sorry for the false alert.

Greetings from France!
