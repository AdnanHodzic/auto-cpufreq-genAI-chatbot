            <h1>Greedy apps causing overheating</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #109</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This isn't as much as an error as what it is something that I've been observing. I often do calls on Zoom and MS Teams, both apps seem to be processor hungry. When I have auto-cpufreq enabled, turbo boost is enabled and the laptop throws everything it can at the process. This results in cores overheating to the extent that they were reaching 95oC. I subsequently had to uninstall auto-cpufreq because it couldn't be disabled.

It would be great if auto-cpufreq had some kind of killswitch that allowed me to turn it off under such extreme cases. Even better would be if auto-cpufreq would be able to identify such cases and engage the killswitch automatically when such cases occur.

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>For analysis purposes, what's the system load/CPU usage/temperature during these calls without auto-cpufreq daemon running? Check by running `auto-cpufreq --monitor` and paste the output here. This is more of a problem with those apps as I have this same behavior on MacBook Pro when running those same apps.

My concern is if turbo was turned off during high core temperatures while CPU is very much needed, that this would only cause more overheating and cause whole system to lag as these app are requesting those CPU resources. 

It would be nice if one such functionality could be implemented. Only (big) challenge would be in distinguishing when CPU usage is high (and yet not that high) for CPU frequency to be (briefly) lowered and yet to keep spinning the fans to lower the CPU core temperatures. 

I noticed similar (edge case) thing when system is running on battery in powersave mode. Since system is running at minimum resources to preserve power, load will (sometimes) become high. But if you just let it briefly run at full power/speed it'll lower the load and then resources could be back to powersave. </p>

                    <p>So I've prepared several dumps that show my system performance under the various scenarios. Most interesting to see is that greedy app does not hog the cpu when daemon is stopped, sticking to low frequency and low temp. When daemon is running, frequencies are boosted ~4000 MHz and core temperature rises:

                    <p>Do you install auto-cpufreq using snap or AUR package? 

If you installed it using snap, out of sheer curiosity could you delete it and install it using AUR package. I'm curious to see if you'll have this same problem again. Just to role out it's not related to #110 

Recently I switched from `core18` to `core20` (Python 3.8) and I'm starting to think this could be a problem behind these issues.</p>

                    <p>@marc0der I think it's because of turbo boost is set?
@AdnanHodzic how do you think? 

turbo boost just increases freq. High freq means high resistance -> high temperature, right?</p>

                    <p>@Red-Eyed yes, but high temperature at ~95oC core temp isn't good for your machine.</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@marc0der  I just [released 1.3](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3) (snap stable updated). Hence, could you please install auto-cpufreq's latest version and include output of `sudo auto-cpufreq --debug`. Also please confirm that temperatures don't get so high on snap now as they used to. As there was one error during build which I ignored which has now been addressed.

And what are your (approximate) average temperatures? 

@Red-Eyed 

> So, maybe we should disable boost on high temperature?

I think that's what we should experiment with, if one or more cores has hits >= 90% turn off turbo boost. One or more cores temp is <= 80 (turn it back on).

I think we need to dial it back a bit, and make "turbo on" bit less trigger happy. Example, my current load stats:

```
Total CPU usage: 4.4 %
Total system load: 1.35 

High load, setting turbo boost: on
```

This is definitely not a "high load" on system with 8 cores, and not sure if there's need for turbo to be triggered at this point ...

as I mentioned in a comment [above](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/109#issuecomment-688667682)

> I noticed similar (edge case) thing when system is running on battery in powersave mode. Since system is running at minimum resources to preserve power, load will (sometimes) become high. But if you just let it briefly run at full power/speed it'll lower the load and then resources could be back to powersave.

This should be implemented also. Turbo is off, load is really high (while CPU is low), turn turbo boost on, load is low again, turn turbo off again.

What we have is great, but I think next step in auto-cpufreq's evolution is to make turbo on/off triggers more refined and have them change states more often based on various (new) different factors which are not included now.</p>

Well, when it's in performance mode (charging) and then it's more easily triggered. In my case above laptop is charging.</p>

This sounds like a good first stab at solving the problem to make it less trigger-happy as you say.

Keep up the good work, this tool has great potential for linux laptop warriors like myself.</p>

@marc0der 

This is much better, I would say even totally acceptable. I made a another[ release in meantime (1.3.1)](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3.1). 

On it I experimented bit with overheating, it turns out that turning "turbo boost off" won't do anything (as expected). But simple hack you could do next time CPU temperature gets really high (95°C territory). Could you simply pull the unplug it from the charger? This will force it to switch to "powersave" governor and I'm curious if this will lower the temperature for you (while speed should still remain the same thanks to turbo being on). 

And next time could you also please include output of `sudo auto-cpufreq --debug`? Thanks</p>

High CPU temperature means a weak cooler system.

`auto-cpufreq` just legally changes CPU configuration.
On my desktop, I run heavy tasks (Deep Learning training) for days with performance scheduler and with turbo boost on, and it is under 70°C.
Also, I use my laptop and didn't get high temperatures, and even if I would get high temp - it's not because of `auto-cpufreq`, but because of bad cooler system.

@AdnanHodzic should `auto-cpufreq` be responsible for temperature thresholds?</p>

> But simple hack you could do next time CPU temperature gets really high (95°C territory). Could you simply pull the unplug it from the charger? This will force it to switch to "powersave" governor and I'm curious if this will lower the temperature for you (while speed should still remain the same thanks to turbo being on).

As if this works as I suspect it might ...

I'd simply switch governors back and forth (instead of turbo) once certain temperature has been reached. </p>

                    <p>@Red-Eyed so you are saying that the Lenovo Carbon X1 is a badly designed laptop with a bad cooler system? I think not.
I compile Scala on my laptop every day and it never overheats. The moment I try to perform intensive tasks like this with auto-cpufreq enabled the cores overheat. The problem is clearly not with my laptop...

@AdnanHodzic no probs, I'll include before and after debug logs next time I do this.</p>

When not running CPU intensive tasks, my X1 Carbon (7th gen) will go as low as 48°C. But then if I'm stressing the CPU to the max, it'll go as high as 95°C (which for me, is expected). 

Laptops definitely don't have as good cooling systems as desktops. This topic always reminds me of [MacBook Pro with Intel i9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx8J125s4cg) not being able to reach even close to its max clock speed due to its chassis design.

> @AdnanHodzic should `auto-cpufreq` be responsible for temperature thresholds?

TBH, I'm not sure, doing this might be going down the rabbit hole. But I'm definitely willing to experiment to see how things can be further optimized. If doing things mentioned in my last comment would improve overheating problem, without compromising anything else `auto-cpufreq` currently does ... then I don't see a reason why not to implement it ...

                    <p>@marc0der  I made some [changes in turbo-lover](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/turbo-lover) branch, you can get them by installing `auto-cpufreq` from snap beta channel:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta
```

Now it's using more conservative settings and turbo isn't triggered as easily as before. Let me know how it works for you.</p>

                    <p>After thoroughly testing changes for few days, I've merged them with `master` branch and made [1.3.2 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3.2). These changes have also been promoted to snap `stable` channel. 

If you've been using beta channel you can switch to stable by running:

```
sudo snap switch --channel=stable auto-cpufreq
```

@marc0der I'm closing the issue as I'm sure it'll solve your problem. A lot of points which were discussed here that could be improved have been implemented. Temperatures have also been dropped drastically in my case although I didn't think of this as a problem. This was also confirmed in #118 

I'm still interested in hearing your feedback when you get a chance, and please re-open the issue if the problem persists.</p>

                    <p>@marc0der update: you were the first one to report this problem, over time I also got couple of more similar comments which got me paying closer attention to the overheating problem. After analyzing this for more then a month I noticed I had the same problem you were experiencing (although my was lot less severe then yours).

I noticed that CPU temperatures would be lot higher when turbo was enabled. For me this problem was happening with and without auto-cpufreq as long as turbo was enabled. 

Either way, I believe overheating problem has been addressed as part of [v1.5.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.5.0). My laptop's batter has never lasted this long, geekbench results have never been higher, meanwhile laptop remains as cool and quiet as possible at the same time.

Would love to hear your feedback!</p>

                    <p>Hey @AdnanHodzic, thanks for the update! 

I'll most certainly give it another spin over the next few days. I've just received my new laptop, a Dell XPS 13, and have installed Debian Bullseye with auto-cpufreq. At first glance, things are looking good, although it seems like turbo mode is always on even when on battery. This is even true when the machine is completely idle. Is this expected, or should turbo mode be off? Let me know if I can send you any more info.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@marc0der as always excellent observations. I just [release v1.5.1](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.5.1) which should address issue you were mentioning. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you.

In case something isn't working as expected, please include output of:

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --debug
```</p>

                    <p><strong>marc0der:</strong></p>
                    <p>I've just installed v1.5.1 and it looks like the turbo mode is behaving as expected. I'll do some further testing over the next day or so and report back anything here. I'll close the issue if I have no further problems.

                    <p>I've done some testing today with `v1.5.1` while working and still seeing some inconsistencies:

When the laptop is on the power supply, the governor is set to _performance_ with turbo boost _on_. However, the CPU frequency always remains around 1300MHz.

The specification for my CPU states that turbo mode should see frequencies of around 3900MHz under load. I tested this by compiling a sizable Rust project where all CPUs were blazing at near 100% capacity for around 10 minutes. The temperature does stay low at around 60oC, but it would still be nice to benefit from the higher CPU frequencies of turbo mode under such high loads. WDYT?

This is weird and definitively shouldn't happen. As now in v1.5.0 [if charging and it detects >= 20% CPU usage](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/source/core.py#L476) it should go to the maximum it's capable off.

I think the problem is probably related to i7-1065G7 support on 4.9 Linux kernel (or some BIOS setting?). As from what I see here, it's maximum frequency seems to be capped at 1300MHz.

Could you please do me a favor and create a new issue for this? Since this one was related to over heating and that seems to be fixed now.</p>
