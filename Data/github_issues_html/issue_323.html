            <h1>PopOS pull request Snap permission denied</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #323</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I just made the pull request that fixed #276 but after updating through the Snap repository, I get this:


```
Warning: Cannot get distro name
Pop!_OS detected
Pop!_OS uses a symbolic link for the os-release file, this causes issues and can be fixed by converting to a hard link
Attempting to change symlink to hard link for /etc/os-release -> /etc/pop-os/os-release

Creating hard link for /etc/os-release

sh: 1: sudo: Permission denied
```
After some searching, it seems that Snap has issues running sudo from `os.system`. You may want to remove PR #311 and release 1.8.2 until this issue is resolved</p>

                    <p>I see, snap container does it's job when touching the files I think. Thanks for reporting this.

@AdnanHodzic maybe you know if this can be fixed, or that we have to exclude this option when running from inside snap.</p>

                    <p>During #276 review process I somehow overlooked that this would be a problem when auto-cpufreq is installed as a Snap package. As in this case, auto-cpufreq is running as part of a container and doesn't have access to host system files. Hence, I just sent a [request for system-files interfaces (hardlink to /etc/os-release)](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/request-for-system-files-interfaces-hardlink-to-etc-os-release-for-auto-cpufreq/28015) with my proposal how this problem should be fixed. 

After this request is approved I would push proposed changes to `snap/snapcraft.yaml`, updating existing (or create a new) snap package release and problem would be fixed. In meantime, let's see what Canonical staff says regarding this request.</p>

                    <p>@tyleraharrison I have one question. If you make this hardlink yourself, outside the snap. And then run the snap. Do you get the same error? 

Are we 100% sure that hardlink `/etc/pop-os/os-release` solve the issue when using a snap? Before we do all kind of stuff to make an hardlink that in the end doesn't even fix the permission denied error.</p>

Ok, thank you :+1: 
Just wanted to be sure :smile: 

If we really have issues creating this stuff from snap context, we could always print a message that they have to create the hardlink themselfs with instructions and then exit. Instead of the automatic route. We will see what happends. </p>

I was about to say this in my original message. In case [Canonical denies my request](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/request-for-system-files-interfaces-hardlink-to-etc-os-release-for-auto-cpufreq/28015) since `/etc/os-release` is not a file own by auto-cpufreq. A simple change where if Snap and Pop OS is detected outputs how to do this manually.

@tyleraharrison if you want you can already make these changes, as I'm planning to release v1.9.0 in next following days. In case changes are accepted by Canonical it'll be easy to remove the custom message what to do manually.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic How does this look? Also what is your preferred way to detect if this is a Snap or not?

If the program is not a Snap:
```
Warning: Cannot get distro name
Pop!_OS detected
Pop!_OS uses a symbolic link for the os-release file, this causes issues and can be fixed by converting to a hard link
You can change the symbolic link to a hard link for /etc/os-release -> /etc/pop-os/os-release
Continue? [y/N] y

Backing up /etc/os-release to /etc/os-release-backup
Creating hard link for /etc/os-release

Checking to see if solution worked...
Success!
```

If the program is a Snap:
```
Warning: Cannot get distro name
Pop!_OS detected
Pop!_OS uses a symbolic link for the os-release file, this causes issues and can be fixed by converting to a hard link
You can change the symbolic link to a hard link for /etc/os-release -> /etc/pop-os/os-release
Continue? [y/N] y

Snap install detected, you must manually run the following commands in another terminal:

Backup the /etc/os-release file:
sudo mv /etc/os-release /etc/os-release-backup

Press [Enter] to continue...

Create hard link to /etc/os-release:
sudo ln /etc/pop-os/os-release /etc/os-release

Press [Enter] to continue...

Checking to see if solution worked...
Success!
```

In the event the solution did not work:
```
Backing up /etc/os-release to /etc/os-release-backup
Creating hard link for /etc/os-release

Checking to see if solution worked...
Failed, aborting...
```

If the OS cannot be read and the operating system is NOT PopOS:
```
Warning: Cannot get distro name
Check /etc/os-release permissions and make sure it is not a symbolic link
Aborting...
```</p>

                    <p>Feel free to add the Snap detection and any other changes to this pull request, it does not have the detection in it's current state, just a dummy variable. I also added the ability for the program to check if the solution was successful and continue instead of continuing without dist_name being set</p>

                    <p>Isn't it a snap only issue? After reading this comment from #240
> I got this error too when installing from Snap on Pop!OS 21.04. I was able to work around by installing with [git instead](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer).

I've installed a VM with PopOS and the `distro` package from a python shell works just fine without changes.
If so it would be lot easier. On permission denied, detect file exists, detect snap, print solution.

I think snap detection is like this:
```
if os.getenv("PKG_MARKER") == "SNAP":
   # we are in snap package
```
</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@tyleraharrison proposed solution how the output would look like good, but @bobslept also summarized it perfectly in his last message. 

> Also, with those plugs just now committed to 1.9.0, will this still build for others if they pull it right now since Canonical hasn't implemented this yet?

No, since those plugs were not approved by Canonical, 1.9.0 release upload to beta channel didn't go through and it triggered a manual review by one of the staff members. As part of feedback I pointed out that request has been made for this and [linked](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/request-for-system-files-interfaces-hardlink-to-etc-os-release-for-auto-cpufreq/28015) to that request for whoever reviews it from their side can see it.

TL:DR: 1.9.0 hasn't been released anywhere yet. </p>

They will respond, but I'm pretty sure they will deny the request, as `/etc/os-release` is not a solely auto-cpufreq owned file. 

Regardless, until we hear it from them I'm closing the issue as changes are live as part of [v1.9.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>

@tyleraharrison response from Canonical is [here](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/request-for-system-files-interfaces-hardlink-to-etc-os-release-for-auto-cpufreq/28015), seems like there is a way to get this working properly with Pop OS.</p>

                    <p>How does this response from Canonical change the fact that we cannot follow the soft link from the "readable" /etc/os-release?

First result is with hardlink, second is with default softlink
```

Am I missing something? Or do you mean open an issue on their github to request if they want to hardlink the file by default.
Or did they approve to make the hardlink from snap?</p>

                    <p>That was a very verbose "no you can't" but I like that. Is there a way to just read the PopOS release file instead of modifying the link? We could just point it to /usr/lib/os-release</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Well that doesn't work on a SNAP package. That gives us the information of the snap container, and not host info. At least it gives different results on my side.

On the host

Regarding to [distro package docs](https://distro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#distro.LinuxDistribution), we could maybe specify `/etc/pop-os/os-release` as argument if we have read access on that file from a SNAP. 

But my snap skills are to limited for quickly testing this stuff.</p>
