            <h1>Adjust CPU frequency scaling on desktop to run in "performance" governor</h1>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This is an updated version of the commit submitted by @librewish | PR: #158  (Fixes #127)

If it detects the device is a laptop, it should default to the regular method of determining ac_state
If the device returns any other output, it should default to ac_state=true

This is my first commit on github ever. I still don't really know much about programming, but with some research, I figured it out.
Couldn't fully test it because I had difficulty running it on arch(Garuda Linux), but I think this should work in theory.

Please test it out on your thinkpad or use your more coding-oriented brain to weed out obvious problems. I got it to compile with no errors and I could run the command "auto-cpufreq", but couldn't get it to run as a system daemon.

Also, sorry if this pull request is not done exactly properly, I am not very familiar with github</p>

                    <p>@ThePoorPilot you did a great job for your first PR and I'm glad you did it for auto-cpufreq :)

Change LGTM now. Since you made these changes based on @Librewish I'll make sure credit you both in [release notes for 1.5.4.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which will be released later on today or tomorrow. 

Thank you for both for your contribution!

                    <p>@ThePoorPilot @librewish there's a problem with using `hostnamectl` as it would require me to request additional automatically connected interface as part of Snap package. Hence, instead of reverting these changes, could one of you please make a new PR to use `dmidecode --string chassis-type` instead of `hostnamectl`?

I would've made changes myself but not sure what it should return if you run it on a desktop. Running `dmidecode --string chassis-type` returns "Notebook"  for me.</p>

                    <p>Returns "Desktop" for me</p>

                    <p>@librewish could you please make a PR with these changes? 

If it's not too much to ask to also update [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/revert-162-master/auto-cpufreq-installer#L123) to also install `dmidecode` as part of dependencies for Manjaro/Arch? You're also welcome to add it for all other distros, otherwise I can do this part.

After which I could make necessary Snap package changes and we could go ahead with 1.5.4 release. 

@crian @yochananmarqos could one of you please add `dmidecode` as a dependency for auto-cpufreq AUR package before this release is made?</p>
