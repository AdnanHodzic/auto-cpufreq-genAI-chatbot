                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Fan won’t stop working even if the cores are at 30°C. I tried using a config file (copied from the one you ship) but as soon as I place it in /etc the program start spamming in the console “Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file”, and the behaviour of the fan doesn’t change at all.</p>
