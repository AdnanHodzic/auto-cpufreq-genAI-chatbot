            <h1>Implement python virtual environment</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #326</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Most of this work is done by @aroundthfur in PR #263 

Based on his PR I've added a few changes.

Seems to work on Fedora 35 with systemd
Seems to work on Gentoo with openrc
Seems to work on Void with runit

Please see if it works for you! :tada:

                    <p>Are we sure this is working on Snap builds? **Or maybe I'm doing something totally wrong.** Yes you did :smiling_face_with_tear: 
I've build 1.9.0 and cannot run --monitor for example
```
beep@pop-os:~/auto-cpufreq$ sudo auto-cpufreq --monitor

Note: You can quit monitor mode by pressing "ctrl+c"

----------------------------------- Warning -----------------------------------

Unable to detect state of GNOME Power Profiles daemon service!
This daemon might interfere with auto-cpufreq and should be disabled.

Steps to perform this action using auto-cpufreq: power_helper script:
git clone https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.git
cd auto-cpufreq/auto_cpufreq
python3 power_helper.py --gnome_power_disable

----------------------------------- Warning -----------------------------------

Unable to detect if you are using a TLP service!
This daemon might interfere with auto-cpufreq which can lead to unexpected results.
We strongly encourage you not to use TLP unless you really know what you are doing.

Going back to dd5d8717696221f7d9a197d495c14f40450c7496 and build snap 1.8.2 will give me a 'working' --monitor

Maybe it's just me because i'm fiddling around on a virtual machine to check this. I hope i'm just doing something wrong. But I think there is more. Or is it another PopOS only thingy....

Edit:
Whoopsie via the software manager I gave permission to `Read process and system information` and now it works.</p>

                    <p>@bobslept if you want to verify if it works on Snap, in auto-cpufreq root dir run: `snapcraft`

With following changes on `master` you'll end up with `auto-cpufreq_1.9.0_amd64.snap`. Install it by running:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq_1.8.0_amd64.snap --devmode
```

But running in this mode, might not give you real overview of how things are working. To remove the snap run:

```
sudo snap remove auto-cpufreq
```

Install with `dangerous` flag:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq_1.9.0_amd64.snap --dangerous
```

After which you want to connect the plugs:

```
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:cpu-control
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:system-observe
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:hardware-observe
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:etc-auto-cpufreq-conf
```

To get inside/run shell inside of a Snap auto-cpufreq container:

```
snap run --shell auto-cpufreq
```

Let me know if you have any other questions and I'll be happy to help you.

P.S: as I [pointed out](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/323#issuecomment-999647910) in #329, 1.9.0 is not released yet, latest version in both stable/beta channels is 1.8.2</p>

                    <p>Yeah it worked out in the end. I forgot to connect the plugs. 
But thanks for the info :+1: </p>
