---
My Thinkpad E14 laptop with an AMD Ryzen 7730U CPU works well with battery with temps staying around 40 degrees most of the time. However, while charging, the laptop heats up to 50 degrees on almost slight to no load. I run a minimal environment (dwm + terminal applications + firefox). This is the default behaviour without any config file.

Having gone through a similar issue (#279), even when turbo is off, the heating issue persists. Albeit in that issue the CPU was Intel (not sure if that makes a difference).


My user-defined config file:
```conf
# settings for when connected to a power source
[charger]
# see available governors by running: cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
# preferred governor.
governor = powersave

# minimum cpu frequency (in kHz)
# example: for 800 MHz = 800000 kHz --> scaling_min_freq = 800000
# see conversion info: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/frequency/mhz-to-hz.html
# to use this feature, uncomment the following line and set the value accordingly
# scaling_min_freq = 800000

# maximum cpu frequency (in kHz)
# example: for 1GHz = 1000 MHz = 1000000 kHz -> scaling_max_freq = 1000000
# see conversion info: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/frequency/mhz-to-hz.html
# to use this feature, uncomment the following line and set the value accordingly
# scaling_max_freq = 1000000

# turbo boost setting. possible values: always, auto, never
turbo = auto

# settings for when using battery power

                    <p>Well before posting, I realized I had not changed the AMD p-state CPU driver to `acpi-cpufreq`. Unfortunately, even after changing to it, I'm facing the same issue.

Even though the sensors don't detect any temp >50 degrees, the base of the laptop heats up quite a bit while charging. @AdnanHodzic </p>
