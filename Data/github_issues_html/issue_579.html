                    <p>When running on battery, auto-cpufreq uses the "powersave" governor which limits your frequency quite a bit (in this case 1200 is set to your minimum). You also have a very old CPU so this limited frequency hinders your performance quite a bit.

To help a bit, you could try increasing your minimum frequency using a config file. Information on this can be found [here](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file) in the README.</p>
