For some reason this same field would be outputted with 2 decimals after ., but being explicit about this definitely helps. 

However, although you didn't make any related changes to "Total system load" field, as part of this PR could you also make same type of change for that field as well. As I just noticed my "Total system load" is now outputting the same way "Average temp. of all cores" was for you.

Example:

```
Battery is: charging

Setting to use: "performance" governor

Total CPU usage: 1.1 %
Total system load: 0.7265625
Average temp. of all cores: 53.5 Â°C

Load optimal
setting turbo boost: off
