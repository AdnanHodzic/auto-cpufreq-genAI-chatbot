            <p><strong>Issue #762</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
Add execution permissions to auto-cpufreq-install, auto-cpufreq-remove, and cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq to enable installation and removal of daemon, as well as statistics (--stats).
The install shell does display **Permission denied**, but goes on as though it was something unimportant. However, the program is not installed properly and cannot be used effectively.

                    <p>I nor anyone [else has ever ran into this issue](https://discord.com/channels/1158239366251020361/1158239367337349164/1274670952570945556). So I'm not too eager to merge changes to files which auto-cpufreq doesn't edit and simply relies on.

I'm not sure what changed or your system that you needed these changes. Hence, instead of accepting the changes or closing the PR, I'll simply leave it be for some time, until I see someone else report that they had the same problem.</p>
