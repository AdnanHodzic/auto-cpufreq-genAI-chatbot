                <p>Hi,

I own an AMD Ryzen 3700U CPU, the turbo isn't enabled when one thread reach 100% of CPU usage. I need at least two of them to reach the 25% of CPU Load.

I fixed it modifying the source code a bit. Since I can create a new branch and push the possible change, I'm attaching the modified file, maybe it can be useful to other users,

Thanks for you good work,
