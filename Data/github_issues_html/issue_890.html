                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>It would be nice if [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-cpufreq-installer) also supported updating/upgrading the service, so same logic can be used for installing & upgrading the service.

Or is the `--install` option already idempotent and could be used for upgrading?</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>This functionality is already there with [--update flag ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#update---auto-cpufreq-update).

It could be improved tho, as it was added long time ago as part of #535 (Closes: #341) and hasn't been touched since then. 

During development and testing things along pulling latest changes, to be on safe side I'll usually just do:

```
./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove
git pull
./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
sudo auto-cpufreq --install
```

If you feel like improving it please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>
