                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi,

while using auto-cpufreq I noticed that it was writing to disk on every loop.

By using strace 
```
sudo strace -f -e trace=file -p <auto-cpufreq-pid> |& grep -e 'open.*WR' -e 'open.*RW'
```
```
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 5
...
```

I saw it was `/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` getting constantly written to which is weird.

It seems to be this part:
https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/ae1f53c737d9f6462e980bc1614ee6ca1f6b36cd/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L286-L299

I'm not entirely sure what should happen here but I don't think `/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` is supposed to be copied in both cases.
