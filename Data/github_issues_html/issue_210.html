I initially had the same issue as #189 but whilst on 20.10. I have since updated to the 21.04 beta and the fix in #189 no longer works. Along with that, it cannot detect the distro either it seems.</p>

                    <p>Okay, I managed to get this working. I had to remove the snap install completely and install fresh and that seems to have gotten around this issue for now. Marking as resolved.</p>

Hey @AMoonRabbit , by installing fresh, did you mean a re-install with snap itself or installing it via auto-cpufreq-installer ?
