                <p>There's a race condition where processes might disappear while filtering. The uncaught exception causes a crash.

                    <p>Nice catch and thank your contribution, but there's one problem. 

On `master` branch changes, if auto-cpufreq daemon is installed (`sudo auto-cpufreq --install`), and I subsequently run: 

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --live   

Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file

Note: You can quit live mode by pressing "ctrl+c"

------------------------ auto-cpufreq running ------------------------------

ERROR: auto-cpufreq is running in daemon mode.

Make sure to stop the daemon before running with --live or --monitor mode
```

or 

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --monitor

Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file

Note: You can quit monitor mode by pressing "ctrl+c"

------------------------ auto-cpufreq running ------------------------------

ERROR: auto-cpufreq is running in daemon mode.

Make sure to stop the daemon before running with --live or --monitor mode

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

But with your changes, if daemon is installed I won't get any of these errors and then we'll have duplicate (live, mointor) instance of auto-cpufreq running which will be counter productive.</p>

                    <p>Looks like I was overcomplicating it a bit. I'm not so familiar with python nor lambdas.

This amended commit seems to do what it's supposed to with daemon running and trying a live session. (and probably as fast as the original function).</p>

                    <p>Great, these changes make lot more sense! I also noticed there's a bug (unrelated to your PR) where user will be able to run multiple instances of `sudo auto-cpufreq --live`.

Again, thank you for your contribution and you made it at the perfect moment as today or tomorrow I'll make a new release in which of course you'll be credited for you work.</p>
