                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed that TLP can (e.g. if I configure TLP to set a maximum frequency of 800mhz, all cores will just use 800mhz)

Why can't auto-cpufreq?</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned in #416, I'll just repeat my questions here, and it would be better if this was asked in [Discussions](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions) section as it's not an issue.

Have you seen [configuring auto-cpufreq section of the Readme](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)? In particular the [2: auto-cpufreq config file section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#2-auto-cpufreq-config-file)? 

Either way, will close this issue as now reference has been made in #416 and discussion can continue there.</p>
