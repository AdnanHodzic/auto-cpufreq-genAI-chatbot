            <h1>fix: display actual EPP and EPB values in stats output</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #894</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Previously, the stats output was showing values from the config file instead of actual system values. This fixes the issue by:

1. Reading EPP directly from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
2. Reading EPB from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/power/energy_perf_bias and converting numeric values to string representations

This ensures that the displayed values reflect the actual current system settings rather than the configured values.
I am new in PR culture, so any suggestion are welcome.</p>

                    <p>I am still not sure, if this can be applied to all systems with different cpus and OS. I noticed that GTK version works good. It works by reading auto_cpufreq_stats_file.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for PR, welcome to open source and let's work on getting these changes merged :) 

I left a couple of comments and I also [asked on auto-cpufreq discord community](https://discord.com/channels/1158239366251020361/1158239367337349164/1433012250482053152) for others to test these changes to make sure they work every architecture. 

Rest of things were raised by Copilot, nothing major but would be good if they were addressed.

Also, to resolve any ambiguity:

Could you please tell me how do your stats output differ before and with this PR? As besides seeing `EPP setting: performance` and `Setting to use: "balance_performance" EPB` it looks the same to me as before.
