                <p>### Description

I have been using auto-cpufreq for quite a while and have been recently investigating into using it with amd_pstate_epp. Everything has been working great except for a error spam of the service. Since everything except turbo boost is working fine I did some investigations.

It seems like amd_pstate_epp is managing its turbo boost in the driver it self and not exposing the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost` flag. This probaply results in auto-cpufreq setting this flag and causing alot of error spam (see below).

Another thing is that intel pstate could also have the same error (see #661).

Also #602 seems related to this.

A simple solution (if my assumptions are correct) would be to just not touch any boost related flags like `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost`. 

Feel free to correct my if I am wrong.

Edit:
I did some benchmarking using the sysbench cpu benchmark. I get on my system better peformance using amd-pstate-epp than amd-pstate and cpi-cpufreq driver.

                    <p>Another thing is also going on (maybe related) the EPP does not contain the value I specified in the config. Seems like my config is just ignored.

Also the error in the log file does not seem to relate to turbo boost. I seems setting EPP per core doesn't work correctly.
This command results in the same error:
