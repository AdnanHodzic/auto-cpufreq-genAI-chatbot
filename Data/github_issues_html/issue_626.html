### Have you tried?
- Reformatted my PC and reinstalled Ubuntu 23.10 multiple times now and reinstalled auto-cpufreq

I am not sure what's going on but everytime I run the installation script it always say permission denied. How do I get through this? This causing such a massive system instability as my CPU is running only at 400mhz. What am I missing?

                    <p>I comes to mind is their migration to Snaps. Obviously it's a guess, but they are setting snaps as main packaging for Ubuntu.
I'm downloading (Huge ISO 4.8GB for a live media one) it to test. Not just for test auto-cpufreq, but other things too.</p>

                    <p>Could you perhaps describe your method of installation? Did you install via snap or via cloning the Git repo or perhaps via some other means? If possible, maybe provide the commands which you ran?</p>

                    <p>Hello @hingen apologies I haven't provided this earlier. So here are my step from fresh Ubuntu Install:
- Install Ubuntu normally, using legacy installer (Their installer from official is not working for me)
- Clone this project
- Run ./auto-cpufreq-installer
- After installation, it installed correctly and without problem.
- When I run sudo auto-cpufreq --stats, it says I am not running in daemon so I install via sudo auto-cpufreq --install
- After installing it says permission denied. I am not too technical on this but it appears I can't revert back by uninstalling auto-cpufreq and also it appears it broke power profile (e.g. I can't select power profile anymore from top-left corner since the option is gone). My entire system lags after that failed installation and upon checking on my cpu cores most of my cores are stuck at 400mhz. Also, uninstalling yields similar error, the python installer just stops complaining of permission denied. Since I am not too familiar to tinker with Laptop battery management I just reinstall Ubuntu 23.10 and repeat the step again. At the time I blame the way I installed Ubuntu or my setup script after I reinstall Ubuntu (I have an automated script that reinstall my machine and put it back to where it was once), my install script basically include step to install auto-cpufreq just as described in the Github page (e.g clone, install, run --stats). Its weird because it was working before, I reinstalled Ubuntu because I jump to Kernel from 6.5-6.7 but it made my system a bit unstable (I was hoping if the kernel fix the screen resolution bug and sdma time out error with AMD GPUs). 

Unfortunately, I have been trying this for 5 times already yesterday and out of frustration just factory reset my laptop, reinstall Ubuntu at the cost of losing some of my weeks progress in the things I am doing then retried my step (5th time) and its still the same.

Obviously, I am not willing replicate this on my machine anymore. If it helps my machine is Lenovo P14s gen 3 AMD and here is my neofetch:

Currently, I am not using auto-cpufreq and just didn't bother and decided to stick with power-profiles that this OS comes with for now.

                    <p>After installing Ubuntu (only worked with legacy installer) I had a different problem running sudo auto-cpufreq --live. When it tries to set the governor, it can´t and errors for each core saying that the "Device is busy". 
I tried to pinpoint the error and added xtrace to the cpufreqctl, but it breaks the python script. Doing the modifications using a separated script or manually in the terminal issues no errors in some actions. I forgot to copy the output, ant it is not in the logs. I'll have to boot to Ubuntu another time to copy it.
I'm resuming modifying the bash scripts, I started way back, but forgot/lost track of time</p>

                    <p>Hello,

I've the same problem with Fedora 41 Workstation. I made the auto-cpufreq-installer file executable (chmod +x auto-cpufreq-installer). After that, I launched the sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer command
Despit it, I've got the 'permission denied' message.
