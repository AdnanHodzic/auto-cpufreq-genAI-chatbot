                <p>Hey there,

I like your tool very much and gave it some testing. On Geekbench 5 I score on the Multi Core test about the same, as when I set my system manually to its maximum. Yet the Single Core test only yields 3/4 of the result. Turbo Boost stays off and the cpu never goes beyond its base frequency then.

Second thing: the log constantly reports that my battery is discharging, even when the ACPI is on-line. Therefore it says it always puts the governor to powersave. Maybe only a logging error since the Multi Core test was good in the benchmark.

Third thing: upon calling the log I get this error:
cp: der Aufruf von stat für '/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts/cpufreqctl.sh' ist nicht möglich: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
cp: call of stat for '/usr....' is not possible: File or directory not found
Looks like something isnt copied the right way.

Here are my specs for reference:

Would be great, if you find the time to look into it. :)

Thx and greetings
