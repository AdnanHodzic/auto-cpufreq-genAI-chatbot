                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have tried setting epp and epb in [battery] so that it goes to power insted of balance_power
I did so by editing the auto-cpufreq.conf example, renaming it and appyling with auto-cpufreq --config
However, when I look at the settings in the GUI app, they still show balance_power. 
I think I might be using the tool wrong, but I need help understanding exactly what I am not doing correctly. 

auto-cpufreq.conf file : 

# settings for when connected to a power source
[charger]
# see available governors by running: cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
# preferred governor.
governor = performance

energy_performance_preference = performance

# EPB (Energy Performance Bias) for the intel_pstate driver
# see conversion info: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/intel_epb.html
# available EPB options include a numeric value between 0-15
# (where 0 = maximum performance and 15 = maximum power saving),
# or one of the following strings:
# performance (0), balance_performance (4), default (6), balance_power (8), or power (15)
# if the parameter is missing in the config and the hardware supports this setting, the default value will be used
# the default value is `balance_performance` (for charger)
# energy_perf_bias = balance_performance
