                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi, while installing auto-cpufreq on an fresh opensuse leap (with #135 installer script), I stumbled on the following warning:
```
You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 20.3.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

Could it be useful to check updates for pip in the install script?</p>

                    <p>Absolutely as long as it doesn't introduce any additional complexity and introduces new problems.</p>
