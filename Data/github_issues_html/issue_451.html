                    <p>This should be in [Discussion](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions) instead. 

Regardless,  to answer your question:

> can I stop disabling of bluetooth on boot?

Quick answer is no. 

I made a [suggestion how this issue](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/92#issuecomment-671425807) could be resolved in #92. I'm also open to an idea that bluetooth remains enabled on boot by default, but in this case to also have a parameter to disable it (as it is now).

Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

                    <p>Hi! I edited main.conf setting back `AutoEnable=true`, but it seems bluetooth still remains off at boot. Any help?</p>

Now it seems to work. I rebooted again. Please, add a toggle or an installation option for this. Like
`let bluetooth continue to start automatically at startup`</p>

Thanks, @AdnanHodzic , I'll see what I can do as soon as I have some time for me! ðŸ”¥

Just another curiosity: does auto-cpufreq interfere with other system default settings, like eg brightness steps control? Maybe I'm wrong or it's just an impression, but after I enabled it I wasn't able to fine adjust brightness like before due to reduced number of steps in the slider

No absolutely not, other then disabling bluetooth it won't touch anything else in "user space".

[As mentioned in Readme, auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script-snap-package-install-only) will [disable GNOME power profiles](https://twitter.com/fooctrl/status/1467469508373884933) to prevent conflicts and various other issues.
