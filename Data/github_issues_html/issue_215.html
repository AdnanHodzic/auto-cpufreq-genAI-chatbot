            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Consider using the pstate-frequency package from this repo [https://github.com/pyamsoft/pstate-frequency] to modify cpu parameters instead of relying solely on the governor to adjust cpu speeds. The utility in question allows for customizability and finer control but lacks the auto adjustment measures of this utility. </p>

                    <p>You can also consider [changing the driver](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#troubleshooting)?

Also, with [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>
