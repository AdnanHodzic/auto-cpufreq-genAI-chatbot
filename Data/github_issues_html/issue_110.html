            <p><strong>Issue #110</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed that `python3` was using a lot of CPU power from time to time, and I checked to see what is the application using python3, and surprise, it was auto-cpufreq, so I removed it completely. Why does this application constantly using a lot of CPU resources?! Isn't that against the main purpose of the application?!

**80 minutes of CPU time**

                    <p>By looking at the screenshot, I don't see any "Massive CPU usage!". I see low (total) CPU usage of 5% and `CPU Time` of 80:51 for auto-cpufreq which is nothing out of ordinary for a system daemon. Especially if that daemon is constantly trying to adjust the CPU frequency and scaling. If you look for CPU Time of i.e: Xorg you'll see it'll have the same or even greater `CPU time`. I suggest you read more on what exactly [CPU Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time) measures.

To debunk your claim, please run following commands in 3 different terminals. 

1. Monitor CPU and MEM usage %, and observe what it is for auto-cpufreq
```
watch ps -C python3 -o %cpu,%mem,cmd
```

2. Observe the total CPU usage and system load:
```
auto-cpufreq --log
```

3. Then fully stress CPU for 45 seconds:
```
stress --cpu 4 --io 4 --vm 4 --timeout 45
```

During this time you'll see that total CPU usage and load will go through the roof, while CPU usage for auto-cpufreq shouldn't move from 0-0.1%. auto-cpufreq is a small app/tool which only uses few megabytes of RAM and shouldn't consume more then 0.1% of CPU at any given time. I believe your problem is with some other Python app.

Since this bug report is based on misrepresentation of system resources and misunderstanding of CPU time, I'm rendering is as invalid and closing it as such.</p>

                    <p>`auto-cpufreq` (Python3) uses 25% of my total CPU usage when my machine is idle since I installed it. That what made me to question its behavior. CPU time for Xorg today for my machine is 8 minutes only, and my machine is up for more than 7 hours.

My report is not `based on misrepresentation of system resources and misunderstanding of CPU time`. Anyway, thanks for closing this issue. Now, I don't have to care if it is fixed or not.</p>

If you do what I suggested below and `auto-cpufreq` is using 25% then that's a problem.

Out of sheer curiosity, because I see you installed using the snap. If you delete the snap and then [install auto-cpufreq using the installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer). Can you do the same thing I suggested above and verify that auto-cpufreq is using substantial % of CPU.</p>

                    <p>I installed auto-cpufreq using the installer, and now I don't notice it at all (I made sure that it is up and running).

The issue is mostly related to Snap, but I will keep the application running for a couple of days to be sure.</p>

                    <p>Okay, good to know. I'm working on some changes in snap which will hopefully fix resolve this issue.

What's distro are you using and could you tell me what running `snap version` in terminal returns?</p>

The application haven't caused any CPU spikes, but my machine froze a lot of times today, and I had to force-restart my machine from a little while, and I had to remove it. I will give it another try later when it is stable enough. Thanks for your help.</p>

@Ahmed-E-86 I'm sorry to hear that, as I and many others have been using it for months without every running into issues you mentioned here. 

> @Ahmed-E-86 why do you think that freezes is due to `auto-cpufreq` ?

@Red-Eyed I'm also curious to hear this, as if this is really the case it should have most priority to be resolved.

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I think we should add loging of cpu/mem usage into file, than analyze it. But logging in debug build

Because they happen after installing auto-cpufeq. If they don't happen after uninstalling it, then it is the cause of these freezes.</p>

                    <p>All those stats look absolutely great to me, especially:

> auto-cpufreq system resource consumption:
> cpu usage: 0.0 %
> memory use: 0.25 %

Since here you can see that `auto-cpufreq` is using 0.0% of your CPU.

Where did you get this 5.8 kernel for 20.04? As that could also be source of your problems. I would suggest you simply wait another month until 20.10 is release and get official >= 5.8 kernel with [Ubuntu HWE](https://ubuntu.com/kernel/lifecycle).</p>

It doesn't stay this way, it spikes every few seconds, not as high as before, but it consumes power from CPU, so I don't think it will help me to save power at all.

Kernel 5.8 is more stable than the default kernel (5.4) on my machine. That is why I use it.

                    <p>It consumes 7% of CPU usage for 2 seconds each 5 seconds, a little less than it was before, but it is still a lot.

I installed auto-cpufreq using snap, and the issue is fixed without changing CPU management driver, but I use different Linux distro and different Linux kernel. Anyway, I use the same machine, and the issue is fixed. Thanks.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I am sorry! I was wrong.

I tested auto-cpufreq using this command >> `sudo auto-cpufreq --live`, and it was working fine, but after installing it using this command >> `sudo auto-cpufreq --install`, the same issue happened again.

Not only that, but I tried disabling `intel_pstate` from the grub, updating the grub, and restarting my machine, but that did not help at all.

CPU usage increased to more than 7% every 5 secs, it is better than it was when I reported this issue, but it is still high.</p>
