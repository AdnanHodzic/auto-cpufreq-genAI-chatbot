Settings in the default config (`/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf`) are not being applied and when trying to use the `--config` parameter that error gets thrown. The file on my desktop as well as the file at the default location both have the example config from the readme.</p>

                    <p>@abvee it seems like this is something missing as part of changes made to installer as part of #459. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

                    <p>nevermind I was just being an idiot and forgot to uncomment the lines containing the frequency settings.

I don't know what the problem with the `--config` option is but the default config loads fine. Thank you for your quick reply.</p>

This seems to be an issue before my PRs..... I think the path in `auto-cpufreq` itself is wrong ??? 

I reverted to a state before my PRs were made and the `install` function in the installer put the `scripts` directory in `/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq`.

I went back even further.... to about September 2020, and the installer still puts the scripts in `/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq`, but the actual python script seems to be looking at `/usr/share/auto-cpufreq`

This bug with `--config` seems to have been around for a long time. Also, the `scripts` folder seems to be completely untracked. The `remove` function in the installer doesn't remove the folder, and I still have to check if `auto-cpufreq --remove` removes it either.</p>
