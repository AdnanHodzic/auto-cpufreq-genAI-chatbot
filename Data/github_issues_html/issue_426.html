Hi Adnan,

I've installed and configured auto-cpufreq via Snap. Although I've seem to run into the issue that the CPU actually isn't scaling down to my set freq in the config file (see debug output). Any tips on how I can remedy this?

In case someone else is having the same problem, how to change to `acpi-cpufreq` is mentioned in https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#troubleshooting</p>
