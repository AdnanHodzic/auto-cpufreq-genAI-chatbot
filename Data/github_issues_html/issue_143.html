            <h1>The `--log` option attempts to perform write operations</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #143</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When running `auto-cpufreq --log`, it seems as though `cpufreqctl` is being invoked in such a way that it attempts to set some energy performance preference. The function in `cpufreqctl` that is failing is the following:

```
function set_energy_performance_preference () {
  if [ -z $CORE ]
  then
    i=0
    while [ $i -ne $cpucount ]
    do
      FLNM="$FLROOT/cpu"$i"/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference"
      echo $VALUE > $FLNM            <--- FAILS HERE!
      i=`expr $i + 1`
    done
  else
    echo $VALUE > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$CORE/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
  fi
}
``` 

On a log command, I would expect to see only read operations being invoked, no write operations. I'm seeing these write errors even when the command is run as the `root` user. ~~The version of `cpufreqctl` on Manjaro is `20`~~.
_On closer inspection I was surprised to see that the installed version of `cpufreqctl` is moved away to a backup file and replaced by a new one. I really don't think this is a good idea, but that's a separate matter that I'll raise in a new issue later._

I've installed `auto-cpufreq` using the AUR package and running it as a service under `systemctl`.

**Update:** I've discovered that the below error output only occurs when the laptop is plugged in and not when it is running with turbo boost off on battery.

Reason for this is that some changes were made to [auto-cpufreq's version of cpufreqctl](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/cpufreqctl.sh), and to make sure we're using this version that's the reason why if present, `cpufreqctl` will be turned into a backup and be restored after auto-cpufreq removal. Decision was made in this #84 to also have same changes in AUR package.

It seems like this is the same problem as outlined in: #138. Solution [was also proposed](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/138#issuecomment-753672590), but I haven't had time to look into it and have proposed for someone else to create a PR for this. If you're up for it, give it a try as I would love to review these changes :)</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Changes which should address this problem are now live as part of [auto-cpufreq 1.5.2 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.5.2).</p>

                    <p>I think this should be fixed with [auto-cpufreq 1.5.3 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.5.3) and changes made to improved logging, could you please confirm? </p>
