            <h1>CPU frequency scaling frozen in auto-cpufreq --log</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #112</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed that while using `auto-cpufreq --log`, in the section CPU frequency scaling, total CPU usage and total system load remain the same after every refresh. I tried restarting the system but, after that, the load and the turbo boost settings seems also to be frozen. From the debugging output it seems that turbo boost is always on at the moment, even though the load is not high. The problem also persist when using the battery. So I don't know if it's only a matter of displaying correctly the log or if it affects the CPU frequency scaling itself and/or turbo boost settings.

                    <p>No, output in both `--log` and `--debug` should reflect actual turbo status. The reason behind this might be because `intel_cpufreq` driver is being used on your system, hence I don't think it's reading turbo state correctly since for `intel_pstate` turbo is on different location. 

Do you have any idea why `intel_cpufreq` is being used on your system? On Intel i7 `intel_pstate` is being used by default for me. 

Can you share output of:

```
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost
```

@Red-Eyed what driver is used for you on AMD?</p>

I'm trying to understand why, without much success.

### `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo` output:

1

This validates my prediction. 

I think it would be easiest if you used `intel_pstate`. Normally it should be automatically enabled/loaded. I'm not sure how comfortable you are editing `grub.cfg`, there are some resources [how to disable it on Fedora](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/121410/setting-cpu-governor-to-on-demand-or-conservative). Maybe try to figure out a way how to enable it?</p>

I will try, thanks for the help.</p>
