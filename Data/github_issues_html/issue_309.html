                <p>It would be nice to add options to set the min/max frequencies on AC or battery since these are available on tlp.

                    <p>It would be great to have this functionality and it would be ideal for the [config file](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq). 

Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution).</p>
