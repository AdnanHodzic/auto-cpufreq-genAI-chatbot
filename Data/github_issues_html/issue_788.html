            <p><strong>Issue #788</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This PR improves the detection mechanism for TuneD on the host system. 
Previously, when TuneD was removed or absent, the system would generate an error when removing auto-cpufreq deamon or when starting the software in live mode:
~~~
* Enabling TuneD

Unit tuned.service does not exist, proceeding anyway.
Failed to enable unit: Unit file tuned.service does not exist.`
~~~

With this improvement, auto-cpufreq now gracefully handles the absence of TuneD without producing misleading errors.</p>
