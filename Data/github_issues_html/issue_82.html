                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I've started using the tool and loving it so far. Good work!

After installation, the `auto-cpufreq` service is continually outputting the full payload of the `--log` command to the system logs. 

When tailing the logs with `journalctl --follow`, I see a continual stream of these log reports being dumped in the log every 5 seconds.

```

Should this perhaps rather be a one-line summary whenever the state of cpu scaling is changed by the tool?

I also further noticed the continued references to a `/var/log/auto-cpufreq.log` file in the service descriptor and elsewhere, but this file never seems to be created. I tried creating it myself, but it still doesn't get populated with the logs.

I realise that these are just teething issues that still need to be sorted. Keep up the great work!</p>

                    <p>First of all thank you, will do :)

I remember this same thing was mentioned in #53. Hence, I think it would be a good think to address this issue in one of the future releases.

                    <p>Great stuff. Some further digging has revealed that all logging is done straight to standard out. Perhaps this issue could be circumvented using targeted logging using a logger library. I could look into this, but since python isn't my first language I'm not promising anything.</p>

                    <p>Go for it, it would be amazing to see a PR from you :) Otherwise, even if you find a nice library that could be used for this purpose that would also be great.</p>

                    <p>Released a fix as part of 1.2.3 version which is available in beta channel, install it by running:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta
```

After you confirm it's working as expected for you I'll promote it to stable channel, merge changes with master and close this issue.</p>

                    <p>I just tried it out and it works perfectly :+1: </p>

                    <p>Awesome, enjoy.

Changes have been promoted to stable channel, hence if you want to move back to stable from beta, can you do so by running:

```
sudo snap switch --channel=stable auto-cpufreq
