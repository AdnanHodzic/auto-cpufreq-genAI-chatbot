                <p>I am using Fedora Silverblue and would love to be able to install auto-cpufreq from the software center via Flatpak. Have you considered building a flatpak package?</p>

                    <p>Of course, this topic has been discussed in #71 and unfortunately it seems it's not possible due to [Flatpak limitations.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/71#issuecomment-685224661)</p>
