            <p><strong>Issue #339</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed my fan was running a lot. So I uninstalled `auto-cpufreq` and tried [power-profiles-daemon](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon#power-profiles-daemon) instead. That app comes with the command `powerprofilesctl`, which prints:

```
  performance:
    Driver:     intel_pstate
    Degraded:   yes (high-operating-temperature)
```

If the **performance** option is degraded, I would think it preferable to not run it. Now that it's not running via `auto-cpufreq`, my fan doesn't run so much.

                    <p>Consider making siniliar configuration as part of [auto-cpufreq config file](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) or even [changing the driver](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#troubleshooting).</p>

                    <p>I had already tried the alternative driver. I'll try altering the configuration. Thanks.

                    <p>@Pound-Hash changes regarding setting `balanced` mode with `power-profiles-daemon` were merged last night as part of #349, hence can you try pulling latest changes from `master` and see if you still have the same problem? There are some ongoing PR's and after they've been merged I'll make a new release. Also make sure to include `auto-cpufreq --debug`

@molitona I think problem in your case is that your charging states are not detected properly, originally introduced with #308, hence @bobslept could you please take a look at this? Thank you</p>

I haven't tried it yet. The problem was resolved a few weeks ago when I simply disabled performance mode. </p>

Sure, but I'm sick and I have a lot of personal issues to tend to. I won't get around to playing with Linux for a couple weeks. </p>

                    <p>I misremembered what I did earlier. I didn't actually disable performance mode; instead, I disabled **turbo**. I just installed the latest version. Testing now with turbo reset to auto.</p>

                    <p>Just [released v1.9.2](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which adds ability to change power governor used by default with auto-cpufreq from `balanced` to `performance` [using power_helper.py script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script). Curious to hear if you still have same problem if you switch to `performance` governor?</p>

What you explained here is exactly how system should act under these circumstances, hence could you please elaborate on what exactly is the problem?

Also make sure you don't have `laptop-mode-tools` installed as mentioned in #365 </p>

My question was stated in the OP.

`powerprofilesctl` says the performance option is degraded, and seems to also say that it causes high operating temperature. So the question was, should we be running it at all.</p>

                    <p>You should and [should instead used "balanced"](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq), closing the issue please feel free to re-open if you're still facing the same issue.</p>

Which is good, but then you stated you're facing this issue:

>My fan accelerates when building from source if performance is allowed. If I enable turbo, it accelerates more; if disabled, it >accelerates less. Conversely, if I disable performance and turbo, then the fan will never accelerate even when building from >source.

What I was trying to say is you should [switch to auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#configuring-auto-cpufreq) `performance` mode. I just updated this section of README to make it more elaborate on how to do so. Namely, I had this same problem as (#361) and I fixed it by introducing this mode.

Hope it's all clear now :)</p>
