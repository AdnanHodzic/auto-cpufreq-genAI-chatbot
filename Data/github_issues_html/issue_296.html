                    <p>Maybe this issue is related to issue #277.
You can try the gnome-power branch and see if that fix your problem.</p>

I see you manualy ran the commands. The gnome-power branch would do this for you automaticly. Glad to hear that it solved your problem. 

It should not bring any problems. power-profiles-daemon is doing power management, which is in conflict with the power management that auto-cpufreq will do. So auto-cpufreq will take over, but in a slightly different way. I'm running for about a week now with the power-profiles-daemon disabled and havent seen any errors or problems so far. </p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, could you please test final changes before I merge them with `master` and make them part of 1.8.0 release.

Latest changes are available on `gnome-power-v2` branch, which you test by running:

```
git fetch
git checkout gnome-power-v2
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
```

For those using Snap package changes are available as part of beta channel which can be installed by running:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta
```

Thanks!</p>
