                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi! Great piece of code! I just have a question which could become part of documentation: what is the overlap with thermald? It's clear the auto-cpufreq is a replacement for TLP, but I couldn't find any information about the integration (or not) with thermald.</p>

                    <p>Thanks! 

auto-cpufreq works great with thermald and I'd even recommended to have both auto-cpufreq and thermald running at the same time (that's how I have it).

Will close this issue, if you still have any questions and/or comments, feel free to re-open it.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic Can you document it on README? I think more people could have this same question in the future.

Sure, as this question does keep popping up, added as part of ["Why do I need auto-cpufreq"](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/README.md#why-do-i-need-auto-cpufreq).</p>
