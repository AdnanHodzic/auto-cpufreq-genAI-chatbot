                    <p>Many new changes have been implemented as part of 1.2 release and I believe your problem is solved. 

Install latest version using snap package:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq
```

or pull the latest changes and run:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer
```

In case this doesn't solve your problem, please feel free to re-open this issue.</p>

I have posted my syslog</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Seems like this issue is identical what was reported in #82 </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>Any news about that?
I had to disable auto-cpufreq as it prints too much to my syslog
I thin that we should increase the priority of this task</p>

                    <p>I'm swamped IRL, but I'll do my best to take a look at this tonight.

Seems like this issue is only present on snap environemnts, as I couldn't replicate the problem when `auto-cpufreq` was installed using `auto-cpufreq-install` installer.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Released a fix as part of 1.2.3 version which is available in beta channel, install it by running:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta
```

After you confirm it's working as expected for you I'll promote it to stable channel, merge changes with master and close this issue.</p>

                    <p>Fix has already been confirmed in #82. Please feel to re-open if the problem persists. Changes have also been promoted to stable channel, so in case you switched to beta, you can switch back to stable by running:

```
sudo snap switch --channel=stable auto-cpufreq
```</p>
