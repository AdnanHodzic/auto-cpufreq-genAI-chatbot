When I read about auto-cpufreq, I was only aware of the snap package and installed it. Afterwards, I noticed that I can't run the GUI version due to snap's sandbox limitations. So, I removed the snap version, cloned the git version and ran the installer.

Now, the auto-cpufreq icon is available amongst my programs, but nothing happens when I click on it. For all intents and purposes, it seems to be running just fine, but reading those errors in the application log just irks me to no end.

Would be great if somebody could chime in who has a deeper understanding of the inner workings. ðŸ˜Š

                    <p>Hi @shadeyg56, thanks for getting back to me. Unfortunately, 3.8.10 is the current max my Distribution offers and going by related forum posts it's not advisable to go beyond.

Would you happen to know what particular version is required? I looked around, but I couldn't see it mentioned anywhere. ðŸ¤”</p>

                    <p>If you can't get newer python version with your distro I suggest you start using pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv and just install latest version (i.e: 3.12)</p>

                    <p>Hello,

I have the same problem. But in my case, I'm on Fedora 39 with the last python version (3.12). After I installed auto-cpufreq with the installer (source version), I had the gui, but now, each time I launch the software through the application grid under Gnome 45, nothing happens.

Regards.

I'm gonna look into pyenv. Still odd that Tuxman2 has the same problem with the recent version of Python, though. ðŸ¤”</p>

                    <p>Hi

I also have a similar issue, however for me the GUI doesn't open when I'm not connected to the internet (as soon as I connect to the internet I can open the GUI through Gnome grid app menu).

I've installed auto-cpufreq with auto-cpufreq-installer
Running Fedora Linux 39, Gnome 45.1, Wayland, Kernel Linux 5.19.10-200.fc36.x86_64
EDIT: Running Python 3.12.0</p>

Not sure if this is the same issue but I'm able to reproduce what you're describing.

Suspect it might be caused by the following lines of execution:
[handle_update](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/fe296206462f204c3abb9d73e005fccd8c8a6bb6/auto_cpufreq/bin/auto_cpufreq_gtk.py#L18) > [check_for_update](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/fe296206462f204c3abb9d73e005fccd8c8a6bb6/auto_cpufreq/gui/app.py#L84) > [exit(1)](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/fe296206462f204c3abb9d73e005fccd8c8a6bb6/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L181)

If that is the case, wonder if a failed update check should `return False` instead of call an `exit(1)`. 

If it is indeed a separate issue, might want to create a separate issue for it</p>

                    <p>Considering changes proposed by @hingen in #629 are now merged with `master` branch. @OddSquirrel can you confirm if this fixes the problem once you pull the latest changes?</p>

Yes, @AdnanHodzic, please excuse the delayed response. Everything is working just fine now. Thank you for your time.

Mind you, I also switched from Zorin OS 16 (based on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa) to Zorin OS 17 (based on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish), so that might have played a role as well.</p>

                    <p>I downgraded from Zorin OS 17 to 16, cause I was experiencing freezing issues, but the GUI worked fine wile I was on 17. Currently on 16 and it doesn't work.</p>
