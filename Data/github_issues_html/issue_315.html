            <h1>[Request] Change CPU governor based on battery level</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #315</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Currently `auto-cpufreq` changes governor according to power state (Charging and Discharging), right?

I think it would be awesome to be able to set governor based on battery levels as well. 
For example,
Charging state governor: `performance`
Discharging state governor: `schedutil`
If battery is below 40%, governor: `powersave`

Thanks</p>

                    <p>I agree, this would be a good feature. Is there a way to manually control the govener?</p>

Yeah, by editing `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf`</p>
