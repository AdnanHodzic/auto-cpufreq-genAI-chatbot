Installed via your install script today.
The output of --stats remains empty. It remains with showing the exit hint (ctrl-c) and nothing more shows up.
Also the --monitor output shows, that the suggestions are not executed. Suggestions and current state differ constantly.
I also noticed that the suggested governor is always "performance", even with nothing to do.

I don't know whether or not the governor is managed by Solus itself and where I could change that, neither do I know what and where I should set the intel_pstate stuff...

I like this project a lot and would really assure it runs as intended on my machine...</p>

                    <p>Okay... had a look into the `auto-cpufreq.service` file and found out, that the filepath is wrong.
Changed the line
`ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon`
to
`ExecStart=/usr/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon`

The path was simply wrong :)

Now the --stats flag does have a decent output and --monitor states that it already runs and to use --stats.

At least it runs now. Can now try how it does on my machine.</p>

Good to know this had to be done for Solus to work properly. If you're happy with results of auto-cpufreq could you please add this as path for Solus in case that's the distro that's detected and create a PR? The least I could do is credit you for this as part of one of future [releases](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases). Thanks!</p>

I'm very satisfied with your software! 
I am currently in a business trip, but will try to do the change asap.
Thank you!

                    <p>@DasJott once you've established that changes work, I'd like to have them upstream as well. Please make your changes and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pulls) which I'll be glad to review. If your changes are accepted you'll be credited as part of [releases page](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).
