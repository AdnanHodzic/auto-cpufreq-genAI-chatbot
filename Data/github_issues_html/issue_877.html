### Error output:
N/A

### System information:

Add/paste output of:
This bug is solely about GUI font size, and has nothing to do with the daemon.
Linux distro: Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat                                                                         
Linux kernel: 6.8.0-79-generic

auto-cpufreq version: 2.6.0

Python: 3.12.3
psutil package: 6.0.0
platform package: 1.0.8
click package: 8.1.7
distro package: 1.9.0
Cinnamon 6.0.4

Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

In Cinnamon menu choose "Font Selection" -> under "Font settings" set "text scaling factor" to 1.5 (or more).
Observe the font size in GUI remains the same (small), while the font size in all the other windows significantly increases.
I believe auto-cpufreq is the only GUI that did not respect "text scaling factor" in Cinnamon (at least on my setup).
Especially on HD laptop screen (or higher resolution on smaller screen sizes) it makes it very small font in auto-cpufreq GUI, which is very hard to read.

Expected: GUI should adjust font size wrt to the "text scaling factor" in Cinnamon.
Thank you.</p>

                    <p>What if you [change font-size ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/d7941e848cf1c68ca505b5640499e15b267bb25f/scripts/style.css#L3)to something bigger, then re-install auto-cpufreq with auto-cpufreq-installer and auto-cpufreq --install?

Ideally font could be increased by `ctrl + +` but unfortunately this is currently not possible.</p>
