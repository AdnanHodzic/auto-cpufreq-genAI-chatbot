                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Simple enough, just updating the version in the nix package to the newest and went ahead and updated the lock file while I was at it</p>

                    <p>It would be great if version could be picked up as it is for [snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L34), this way we only need to update one file and it's propagated for all packages ...</p>
