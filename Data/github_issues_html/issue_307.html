                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>So I have a Lenovo laptop which has conservative mode, when I plug in with it on, auto-cpufreq doesn't switch to performance and stays in powersave scaling</p>
            </div>

                    <p>This issue is probably the same as #299, which fixed itself somehow.

I'm not really sure what is going on, because I don't experience this issue myself. I'm on a Lenovo which uses the ideapad_laptop kernel module. But it stays in charging state when I am on 60% when using conservative mode.</p>

                    <p>Then it should be due my system battery status being read as unknown. Thanks anyway </p>

                    <p>Are you comfortable with git and want to test something out?
It maybe fix your issue.

Be sure no other version of auto-cpufreq are installed before testing this.

I made a change on how we check the charging status. 
If you could test if this works for you, it would be great!
If you test this, please also verify if its detecting when you are on battery power only.

```
git clone https://github.com/bobslept/auto-cpufreq.git
cd auto-cpufreq
git checkout fix-charging-state
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
```
Now auto-cpufreq is installed. You can now use it in live mode to test the fix like this:
`sudo auto-cpufreq --live`

to remove all this from your system use the remove function from the installer:
`sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove`</p>

                    <p><strong>ShabirK21:</strong></p>
                    <p>So i tested out the program, and i'm glad to say it works! when my bat status is unknown, the live status reads it as charging and sets the "performance" & switches to "powersave" when unplugged. Awesome! thanks for the fix</p>

                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>Thank you so much for testing this. Very happy to hear it solved your problem! 
We probably need a little bit more users to test this before we actually merge into master.
Thanks again!</p>

                    <p>Thanks to @bobslept the proposed changes have now been merged with `master` branch. Changes will be part of the upcoming 1.8.2 release.  

Until the release is made, changes can be installed by either having latest `master` changes and installing them using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto-cpufreq-installer) or using `beta` channel of Snap package (`sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta`). With that said I'm closing this issue, please re-open it if the issue persists.</p>
