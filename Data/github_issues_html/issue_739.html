### Have you tried?

- [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 

Yes. I tried to keyword match against network.target network-online.target 

- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?
- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?

The main question of this Issue is whether we can remove the dependency from auto-cpufreq.service onto network-online.target. This systemd target blocks until network connectivity which can take several seconds. I do not believe auto-cpufreq uses the network so I believe this dependency can be removed. The blame history points at https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/commit/84e0c6cfa19bf761c1ba85ba8258512adb797072 but I didn't find additional information.</p>

                    <p>> . I do not believe auto-cpufreq uses the network so I believe this dependency can be removed.

I would agree with you on this one, as I can't remember why exactly was this change made.

                    <p>@kevinywlui I just pushed changes which remove network-online.target as a systemd-service in order to increase boot time.</p>
