                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The admonition that this is a substitute, not a companion, for TLP implies the answer is yes, but the list of features suggests otherwise.

If yes, may the list of features become explicit.

If no, then I suggest amending "auto-cpufreq aims to replace TLP in terms of functionality" as that could give a false impression.

                    <p>No, at this time this tool does not have ability to configure battery charging threshold. 

Thank you for your suggestion, in meantime I'll close this issue. Please refer to other "feature requests" in this section if you wish this to be added as a feature in future.</p>
