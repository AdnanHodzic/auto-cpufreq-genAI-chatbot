There should be a restart specification in the systemd file for the service eg.

sudo systemctl edit auto-cpufreq.service
[Service]
Restart=always


[Service]
Restart=always

                    <p>@asenzz Restart in the service file isn't necessary. if it fails once its going to fail again so why try over and over.  

if auto-cpufreq is failing on your system we need the logs to help you out.

@AdnanHodzic i believe this issue can be closed.</p>
