            <h1>Why CPU Freq Crosses Hardware Limits and Policy Limits, and System Heat Up after Hybrid Sleep, in Debian 12 (Testing-Weekly) with auto-cpufreq?</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #525</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Installed `auto-cpufreq` and `thermald`, with `auto-cpufreq.conf `while on charger:

```
governor = performance
scaling_max_freq = 1900000
turbo = auto

```

And, `/etc/default/grub` edited as:

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_pstate=disable"`

Thought it is conflicting/ redundant with some other tools. So, **REMOVED** all other tools: `tlp cpufreq cpupower acpi acpid acpi-support linux-cpupower cpufrequtils cpulimit`

OS: Debian 12 (bookworm: testing-weekly)
Hardware: (Apple: amd64, 16 GB RAM, 8 CPU) limit: 800 MHz - 2800 MHz

**After each REBOOT**, everything (CPU Freq, Temperature, etc.) stays within limits, as set in auto-cpufreq.conf.

But, **AFTER each Hybrid Sleep**, things go out of control: (CPU Freq near 4000 MHz, Temp 95℃, Fan 4900 RPM, etc).

What am I missing?

                    <p>I never encountered anything like that during suspend, hibernate or hybrid sleep and settings stay as they are.

                    <p>I resolved it.
I will write details about it. **Perhaps, it can be used as an 'aside'.**
Because, I noticed that many people struggle with similar issues..
