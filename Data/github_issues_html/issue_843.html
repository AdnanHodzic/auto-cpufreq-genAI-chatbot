            <h1>Replace magic-nix-cache-action</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #843</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The `DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action` action has been [deprecated](https://determinate.systems/posts/magic-nix-cache-free-tier-eol/) and no longer works. This PR replaces it with the `nix-community/cache-nix-action` action, which is actively maintained. It also replaces the `cachix/install-nix-action` action with the `nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action` action, which is required for the cache action to work. The cache has been configured to restore based on the runner's OS and architecture, so it should work on any runner.
