                <p>Hi, Does GNOME team copied what auto-cpufreq to their power-profiles-daemon or what ??
Because, I've noticed same power consumption under same circumstances using powerstat command.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps, I'm not sure and can't say anything until I've seen their code.

In open source it's not uncommon to see instead of contributing to existing code and improving that tool/project, to just fork it and start over on your own without any references to original project.</p>

Ok, do you recommand using powertop tunnable or TLP with auto-cpufreq to manage power consumption for the rest of HW. Does it give any results ? @AdnanHodzic </p>

                    <p>Please read 4th paragraph of [auto-cpufreq README](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/), auto-cpufreq will even detect if TLP is running and make a suggestion to remove it. Not sure if using powertop of tunnable will bring any value if used alongside auto-cpufreq but I don't think they'll conflict with anything unlike TLP.

I'm also closing this as it's not an actual issue and should be part of [discussion.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions) </p>
