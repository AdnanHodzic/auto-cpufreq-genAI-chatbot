- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)? yes. both of them had this issue
- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)? yes
- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)? no (its not related to this issue)

### Problem: 
I have issues running auto-cpu freq --install because that is needed for viewing CPU stats. However, the error says its running in Daemon mode and cannot do it. Please help me out on how to disable daemon and run this!

                    <p>If you don't want to run auto-cpufreq as a daemon then you don't intsall it, instead remove it `sudo auto-cpufreq --remove` as [described on Readme](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon). 

Closing the issue since it's not an issue but more of a question which should be posted on [Discussions page](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions).</p>

                    <p>Yes, as I have filled in the template, I have tried running that line in terminal but, it doesn't detect it! Look at the code below for reference:

```
(base) gauthameshwar@gauthameshwar-ideapad-Flex-5:/home$ sudo auto-cpufreq --remove
[sudo] password for gauthameshwar: 

auto-cpufreq daemon is not installed.

                    <p>@Gautameshwar First make sure you have latest changes (as `f66df2a8` is 2 commits behind) as I wasn't able to reproduce this problem. @shadeyg56 are you able to reproduce this?

Then can you make sure that you don't have both packages installed, i.e: run `sudo snap remove auto-cpufreq`, and `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove`

Both of these will remove any instances of auto-cpufreq running (including daemon). You can verify this with `ps -ef | grep auto-cpufreq` and if daemon indeed was running you'd see something like: `root      376501       1  1 13:39 ?        00:00:01 /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/python /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon`

Once you see that daemon is really not running install auto-cpufreq with i.e: `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install`, followed by installing the daemon `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` and everything should work as it should (`sudo auto-cpufreq --stats`)
</p>

                    <p><strong>shadeyg56:</strong></p>
                    <p>I will test this later to see if I can reproduce

In the meantime, you can also try `systemctl status auto-cpufreq` (if using systemd), to see if the daemon is installed on your system, or if there has been an error involving the daemon. If you're not using systemd as your init system, then change the command accordingly</p>
                </div>

Correct, all of this is [described as part of Readme](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon) as I previously pointed out.</p>
