                    <p>@marc0der since you implemented parallel `cpufreqctl`, it seems like it's missing in this case. Any idea on this one?</p>

                    <p>Hi @AdnanHodzic,

Are we sure that this is related to my change? What I see from this error is that the following file path is missing and can't be read when running `--monitor` mode:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_gov
```

Also, running the debug, I see that this file is missing/not accessible:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/class/power_supply'
```

Do you think that my change might have caused it? It seems like it might be a red herring. WDYT?
```
Driver: /bin/sh: cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq: command not found
```

That said, I could be totally wrong and I'm happy to look at why that line is being printed if you like.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>@marc0der I'm not absolutely sure your change introduced it, but I think it's possible. 

> That said, I could be totally wrong and I'm happy to look at why that line is being printed if you like.

If you have time to look into this that would be great. Think it might be both things.</p>

                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic, I think something else might be going on here. I just tried installing `auto-cpufreq` on my machine bare metal using the installer script, and I get no such error. I also checked, and the parallel `cpufreqctl` is found in exactly the place where it should be at `/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq`.

I also notice an ancient kernel version ( 5.4.89+, my machine is currently at 5.10.19-1). Might this be the cause of the error that these paths have perhaps changed in later kernel versions?

@Avnsx, would you mind sharing the exact steps that you took when installing the tool? Could you also let us know if the following file paths are present and accessible by the root user on your machine?
```
/sys/class/power_supply
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq
```</p>
                </div>

@marc0der not sure about the kernel, reporting from 5.4.0 and I get no such errors. I also might think that for Xeon paths to these 2 might be different:

```
/sys/class/power_supply
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
```

Need @Avnsx to confirm this of course.</p>

Hardware: 
Corei5 6300U
8GB Ram
Elementary OS

1. Install with installer package from git clone with exact instruction from github page.
2. Installer has problem with folder permission on .cache/pip but i eliminated it by specifying "sudo -H" during install.
3. launch the program with _sudo auto-cpufreq_  or just _auto-cpufreq_ gets me the same error as below

Any idea what can i do? (**SOLVED!!**)

I'm not sure if it's a elementary OS issue but i saw someone reporting the issue elsewhere and the solution they provide is to remove 3 packages with below command:
`sudo apt remove -y python3-psutil python3-click python3-distro`

Then proceed the normal installation procedure again, it worked!</p>
