                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi,
One generally needs to use 2 different governors:
1) **with power supply** connected one e.g. likely needs `Balanced` or `Performance`.
2) **Without power supply** connected one likely needs `Powersave`.
So basically **every time power supply connected & disconnected** one  has to manually switch the governor.

It would be great if auto-cpufreq could detect if a power supply is connected and automatically switch between these modes.
Thanks.</p>

auto-cpufreq already automatically switches between these modes and this is [shown in this part of auto-cpufreq Youtube video](https://youtu.be/QkYRpVEEIlg?t=365), few seconds before I also show how governors will change automatically if auto-cpufreq detects load or CPU usage is increasing. 

You can configure this with [auto-cpufreq config file](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file).

Hence closing this issue as described functionality should already be there.</p>
