                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hey! I am facing fan cycling: fans turn off for a couple of minutes, turn on for another couple, and off again ad infinitum. This is a known issue with my system Dell Inspiron 5620. Normally they turn on when one of the CPUs reaches around 47 degrees Celsius.

I resolved this with Gnome power management. Used 'power saving' the whole time. And even when in 'performance' or 'normal', the fans ran smoother. They surely got louder but in a constant manner. Not on and off again.

Since using auto-cpufreq I have had this issue again. 'Powersave' mode is where I get the most cycling. 'Default' and 'Performance' make fans always on, though I think I can hear some constant speed changes.

I have tried switching the driver as suggested in the Troubleshooting section but nothing changed. 

Has anyone faced a similar issue and knows how to resolve it?
