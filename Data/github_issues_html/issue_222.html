            <h1>Does not work properly on Pinebook Pro</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #222</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have installed auto-cpufreq and its system requirements from the AUR and it doesn't seem to work properly. I ran `sudo auto-cpufreq --stats` and it didn't even read the temperatures of the CPU, `sensors` did however. It seems like it only stays on powersave mode. I can confirm this via the software itself and via a plasma system monitor widget. I'll paste the CPU information and the software errors and etc.

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>With [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>
