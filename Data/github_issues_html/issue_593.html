            <h1>Asus ROG - AMD dGPU is up all the time (Hybrid mode) when auto-cpufreq is running</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #593</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This issue was already discussed on https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/278 but closed due to inactivity. Not sure if it's exactly the same root cause, but the consequence is the same.

All the functionality of auto-cpufreq is ok, and it works as intended. However, and I understand that is due to the fact that it has to be monitoring temperature all the time, the dGPU of the computer (when on Hybrid mode) is up all the time. Therefore the energy consumption is much higher than could be.

Running sensors (of lm-sensors package) also does a similar thing, when you run it, to obtain the dGPU temperature, it has to wake it up. I understand that the continuous monitoring of temperature of auto-cpufreq is doing the same, it's getting the temperature of all the sensors of the system, and therefore, requiring the dGPU one, having to wake it up.

I haven't seen any option applicable to configuring auto-cpufreq related with the temperature retrieval. Not very experienced with the psutil package and the methods used by it in core.py but I can give it a try. However I'd appreciate if anyone has more info about the topic.

If I can find anything testing psutil package I'll let it know here.

**Edit 1:**
This line in core.py it's what wakes up the dGPU
`temp_sensors = psutil.sensors_temperatures()`

                    <p>I can confirm I have the same issue as described above. The system loses battery in 1.5 hours. 
If I use Gnome Power profiles instead I get atleast 3 hours of backup.

                    <p>I don't have a dGPU so I can't test this for myself, but your explanation makes sense. Unfortunately, `psutil.sensors_temperatures()` only has a parameter for using fahrenheit.

If psutil is indeed causing the problem, it should be possible to ditch psutil in its entirety as all the function does is check `/sys/class/hwmon*` and return the results in a nice format. So we could just create out own temperature function that checks `/sys/class/hwmon*` and only returns the temp for the CPU rather than returning all sensors and grabbing our correct sensor from that list. </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>@shadeyg56 That sounds interesting, but I guess that hwmon* is different between computer models. Maybe it could be optional in the auto-cpufreq config file, that you can specify the hwmon folder for the CPU temp

Edit: i.e., in my case, if I run sensors the CPU temperature is reported with this one:
`k10temp-pci-00c3
Adapter: PCI adapter
Tctl:         +45.0°C`

Running 'sensors k10temp-pci-00c3' only won't wake up the dGPU, as it only takes this sensors info.

As said above, it'll be interesting to have 1 option where you can specify the sensor name for CPU temperature (or multiple sensors if wanted), instead of getting all of them. Of course, psutil doesn't give this option

Edit 2: 
searching a bit in the internet, an easy way to get it without using psutil could be from these files:
"cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp"
but I'm not sure how standard this is between Intel or AMD and different MB vendors and their drivers. 
Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71187758/cpu-temperature-real-time-with-python-default-libraries
In my case, this returns the temperature in C multiplied by thousand (i.e.: 45ºC => 45000)
But I only have thermal_zone0</p>
