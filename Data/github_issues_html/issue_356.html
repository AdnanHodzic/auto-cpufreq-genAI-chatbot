            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The power governor is currently only configurable depending on if the device is charging or discharging. Have the ability to change the power governor based on current battery life. 

Example use case:
I want to charge quickly, once I charge to +90% use performance governor instead

0%-90% = Powersave
90%-100% = Performance</p>

                    <p>Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>
