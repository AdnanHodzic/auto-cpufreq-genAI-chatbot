            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello,

first of all thanks for this very helpful tool.
I just installed kernel 5.17 (including the new amd-pstate driver) on my system and am experiencing weird behaviour when using auto-cpufreq. First of all, the "min" and "max" frequencies seem to adjust dynamically (seen in auto-cpufreq --stats).
I tested the following scenarios while running prime95 (full cpu-load simulation). When charging, the freq goes only up to 2.3 GHz on all cores, and in battery mode I barely reach 1 GHz. I also experienced low frequencies (when on battery) with kernel 5.15 and the acpi driver.

I tried installing auto-cpufreq through the AUR package, as well as from source. 
Am I doing something wrong, or is using the new amd-pstate driver a bad idea in general?

Thank you very much!

                    <p>Hey, thanks for your answer!
According to the second section you posted: Since I'm Manjaro, amd_pstate seems to be enabled by default. At least the output of "cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver" is correct. Therefore I did not change anything else.

Unfortunately the config file did not change the behaviour when on battery and under full load. CPU is still not scaling over the scaling_min_freq (now ~1.1GHz). To clarify my problem a bit more, here is the output of "auto-cpufreq --debug" under full CPU load on battery, as well as plugged-in.

@riskingh I do not own AMD CPU hence I cannot test this. If you or anyone else wants to submit a PR which could potentially resolve this problem that would be great, as I always encourage users to[ submit code contributions](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution) and credit everyone for their work.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic 
I don't think this is just on AMD CPUs. The `powersave` governor just won't scale up at all on any of my devices. My i7-8550U, i7-2620M and Ryzen 3700U all stay on the lowest clock frequency on `powersave`.

I'm not a big fan of changing existing behavior, which is why my solution to this was to submit the (now merged) PR to add config files. It seems a lot of people would be expecting the behavior of the `conservative` governor on battery.</p>

                    <p>@zoitrok I think you're absolutely right. [According to arch-wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors), the powersave-governor always sets the frequency at it's minimum. I wasn't aware of that before.

Nevertheless, I think there is something fishy about the amd-pstate driver. I experience sometimes weird behaviour when using it. Can anyone confirm that, or might it just be my individual setup?

For now I went back to acpi-cpufreq driver and upgraded to kernel 5.18. Using an adjusted config file, I now get the desired results. Under full load, the Ryzen 7 5700U scales up to 2.3 GHz in charging-mode as well as in battery-mode. Even though it's capable of up to 4.3 GHz, I think it might be limited due to thermals (~75°C @2.3GHz, full load) - am I right?

Below is my current config file for those who are interested. Min and max frequencies are adapted to my specific CPU.


```
[charger]
governor = performance
scaling_min_freq = 1400000
scaling_max_freq = 4369921
turbo = auto

[battery]
governor = conservative
scaling_min_freq = 1400000
scaling_max_freq = 4369921
turbo = auto

                    <p>@mldytech turbo=auto leaves it up to auto-cpufreq to enable the turbo. It takes a bit of sustained load to kick in. In my world keeping it on 'always' gives a more responsive system with no real hit to heat or battery.</p>

                    <p>Hello, I can reproduce. Yesterday night I got `auto-cpufreq` to work, and it did improve performance (while on charge). I installed it via the AUR package and enabled it with the `sudo systemctl enable auto-cpufreq`, then rebooted. Everything worked fine and the performance optimization was _notable_. Today, when I opened my laptop, (battery mode) I noticed the same thing. It was lagging because the CPU was not scaling up and was locked to 500Mhz (CPU: Intel Celeron N2840). I had to manually disable the service manually (with `sudo systemctl disable auto-cpufreq`). Kernel: 5.18.12-arch1-1 x86_64. Please fix that, `auto-cpufreq` brings my old laptop back to life, but with this problem it makes it function even worse :(</p>

I have the same CPU. I was able to correct being locked at 500Mhz by changing to governor = conservative under battery in auto-cpufreq.conf</p>
