I did not see any documentation or issue where this, was mentioned. So here I go:

Is there a way to manually set, perhaps under `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf`, a lower max frequency than the the default one?

For instance, having a `max_frequency=1800` under the `[battery]` setting. 

For context, my max frequency is rather high for me, and I would like to lower it.

Most welcome!

Regarding rest of your question, similar thing was request in #69. But this seems like a very interesting idea to have as part of config file.

                    <p>Just [released v1.9.2](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which adds ability to change power governor used by default with auto-cpufreq from `balanced` to `performance` [using power_helper.py script](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script) which could also resolve this problem.
