                <p>Hi,

Thank you for developing such a tool. The Youtube video is amazing and it's actually the reason why I'm excited about it.

I have Dell Precision 5530, running Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS. I installed the snap package and expected the service (daemon) started. It seems to be enabled but inactive:

```
$ snap services                                                                                                                                                                                        
Service                                   Startup  Current   Notes
auto-cpufreq.service                      enabled  inactive  -
```

Looks like it doesn't really work in the background as it's not changing the governor and turbo boost. How can I enable it?</p>

                    <p>I apologize for such delayed reply. You can check snap package daemon status by running: 

```
systemctl status snap.auto-cpufreq.service.service
```

as explained on projects [README](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon). </p>
