                <p>### Update
I did some more testing and I found that the problem isn't that the processor isn't able to go past 2.5GHz, it actually can. I started doing some music production tests and I saw values up to 4GHz on some cores. Now the problem is that the performance of this laptop when it comes to demanding tasks isn't anywhere close to what it can do with Windows. My conclusion is that since this laptop isn't designed to run Linux that's what I get. Hopefully someday it'll be fixed.

### The problem

Hello! I'm having an issue with an Asus Zenbook 14 Laptop, model UX3402ZA. It has an Intel Core i7-1260p which is advertised to be able to reach a maximum frequency of 4.70 GHz.

The laptop running Windows is able to change between three performance/fan modes: silent, balanced and performance. The last one being required for the processor to reach it's maximum speed. In Linux you can also change between those three modes by modifying the EC registers, there's a [page in the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ASUS_Zenbook_UM3402YAR#Fan_control) which explains it in detail.

So I'm able to set this laptop in performance mode by writing the `0x02` value in the `0x61` EC registry, but the maximum speed reached in average by all the cores is 2.25 GHz, and the maximum speed for a single core is 2.50 GHz. I have tried both `intel_pstate` and `acpi-cpufreq` but the results are still the same.

### I have tried

- ✅ [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 
- ✅ Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?

**I have also tried having thermald both active and inactive with both intel_pstate and acpi-cpufreq. I still get the same result.**

Something interesting I found is that when I release the CPU from the stress test, a few of the cores suddenly burst to almost the limit of 4.7GHz for a few seconds and then come back down. The stress test I'm using is the one in [s-tui](https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui).

The computer overall works great with Linux and I like it way more than Windows, but part of my workflow involves running cpu-intensive programs so in this state it doesn't give me the performance I need, because the system starts to stutter and struggle.

Any guidance is truly appreciated!
