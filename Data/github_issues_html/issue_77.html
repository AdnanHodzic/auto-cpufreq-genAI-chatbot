                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>just built snapcraft, installed it
tried to look at `--monitor`, but it said that I should use `--log` instead

It means that installing new version doesn't remove old one.

@AdnanHodzic could you confirm?</p>

                    <p>This happened because there was a daemon running which `auto-cpufreq --install` sets up. This was made as a preventive measure, for 2 instances of auto-cpufreq not to be running at the same time and thus giving you wrong results.

Hence, as the message says in this case either use log or install (for re-installation) or remove it.</p>
