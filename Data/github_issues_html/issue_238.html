                <p># auto-cpufreq-installer
Some of the changes:
- Intead of a lot of elif use one case statement for the `tool_install` function.
- Merged the repeating pip_pkg_install, separator, complete_msg, etc. into `completed` function which is used by everything but manual install steps, which I add it to a function `manual_install` (more like manual_steps).
# auto-cpufreq-{install,remove}.sh
Before looking at the distro, we look if pid 1 corresponds to `runit`, else we assume systemd as the init. This, hopefully, makes it easier to add 'support' (rather steps) to more inits.


Please take a look at the changes and take your time to review them. 
Hopefully I didn't miss anything, cheers!</p>

                    <p>Hi @explosion-mental I'm sorry for such a delayed reply, finally got time to look into this. 

Could you please resolve conflicts on `auto-cpufreq-installer` and `scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh` files created as part of this pull request? It will result in a cleaner PR and allow me to more easily look into the changes that were made.

Thanks!</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic done. I have one question, does `lsb_release -is` (distro variable) works on most of the Linux distros? I can't recall seeing that command before, it may simplify the 'distro identification'.</p>

Awesome thanks, this is great stuff. Thank you for your contribution and I'm looking forward to any new ideas/PR you may have!

Yes it is, as long as you have the necessary package that provides it, i.e on Debian based distros it's available as part of: `lsb-core`. From my experience on most of the distros it comes pre-installed unless you working with stripped down distros used for container base images. Hence, for this kind of detection I use in most of my projects, i.e: [displaylink-debian](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/displaylink-debian/blob/master/displaylink-debian.sh#L29)

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic apparently [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) uses os-release detection as well, maybe it's a good idea to keep it if the goal is to function on unix like systems?

Anyway, thanks for the proyect!</p>
