Few months ago I have copied default config from readme to my conf file on my desktop pc and only changed turboboost to always. I was playing games in Windows vm with xbox wireless adapter passed to it back then. 

Last week I tried gaming natively on Linux and installed xone driver (xone-dkms in aur) which reports battery level of controller. I then tried playing FS22 (pretty CPU intensive) and it worked great (90-130 fps)... until I connected controller and fps dropped to 30. Then I tried connecting it with wire and it worked normally (because controller doesn't report battery usage when plugged). I noticed that cpu frequency was a bit low (800 MHz). Then I went to look at output of `auto-cpufreq status` and saw that it is using powersave governor and that (controller's) battery was discharging.

In debug output I noticed that program detects computer type. Why doesn't it then just ignore the battery entry in config if desktop type is detected?

I tried connecting my motorcycle helmet intercom to pc and its battery wasn't detected in auto-cpufreq.

Then I looked into `/sys/class/power_supply` and found that xone has made an entry named `gip0.0`
Contents of uevent to help you filter it out:
```
DEVTYPE=power_supply
POWER_SUPPLY_NAME=gip0.0
POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE=Battery
POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS=Discharging
POWER_SUPPLY_CAPACITY_LEVEL=High
POWER_SUPPLY_SCOPE=Device
POWER_SUPPLY_MODEL_NAME=Microsoft Xbox Controller

                    <p>huh thats weird but makes sense. for the time being try overriding the Governor in the auto-cpufreq gui. this will keep the cpu at full performance even when on battery.</p>

                    <p>In addition to what @PurpleWazard said, alternatively you can also [use --force flag](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#2---force-governor-override), or [config file](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file).</p>

                    <p>Seems we need more intelligent battery checking [here](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L245).
We could add `gip0.0` to the power supply ignore list that is defined at the top of the file, but it would be nice to have a solution that keeps this from happening again</p>

                    <p>@shadeyg56 That would be the best solution. And maybe you could also ignore all batteries if desktop is detected + possible override in conf file (in case of ups).</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I made battery portion of config the same as charger as soon as I found out that auto-cpufreq is impacting performance. But it would be nice to have a way to filter out batteries. I haven't yet tested it with xone driver on laptop, but I suspect it would go into battery mode if I connect a controller to a charging laptop.</p>

                    <p>@timrosu appended "feature", until one of the contributors or I get a chance to take a look at this.

                    <p><strong>PurpleWazard:</strong></p>
                    <p>so my idea to fix this is to add an section the the config file where you can ignore specified batteries however then all will be included by default. is this the way this should be inplmented or wanted? or should we just hard code to ingore /sys/class/power_supply/gip* ?</p>

                    <p><strong>timrosu:</strong></p>
                    <p>@PurpleWazard I think it would be best to add option to add batteries to ignore in config file and then show this option in readme. Names of problematic batteries could be included by default in conf file and ignoring enabled.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I think it's good as it is (apart from spelling mistake in config comment).</p>
