I have the following lines on my auto-cpufreq.conf 

[battery]
energy_performance_preference = power
energy_perf_bias = power
energy_perf_bias = power

However, as shown in the screen shots, the settings remain as balance_power. How can I make them change all to power so I can have maximum battery savings? 

Hope that is more clear now.

                    <p>your config file isn't been applied. in order to apply your settings, you need to put your config file in `~/.config/auto-cpufreq/` directory 
it will look like this 
`~/.config/auto-cpufreq/auto-cpufreq.conf`
after restart 
you will see the config file path in System Information section in Stats mode

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>What was said above, you're using wrong location for your config file. Ideally place it in `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` as instructed in [config file as part of README](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file).
