                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>### Error output:
```text
None from system log.
When set to governor powersave, CPU never goes beyond 1400 GHz. even when boost is enabled.
¨powersave¨ is the setting auto-cpufreq enforces when on battery

I created a config file. In the config file "/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf " I have set it to use ondemand when on battery. 
The daemon does not use/respect that setting however and will always set powersave mode. 
When on battery my laptop is limited to 1400 Ghz whatever I do. Even though boost is enabled 
it will not boost beyond that.

Also I notice the daemon does not use the lenovo specific settings It should activate 
battery saving mode when on battery.:

Current mode : 0x0
Key
0x0 = Intelligent Cooling
0x2 = Battery Saving
0x1 = Extreme Performance
Battery protection setting
Battery protection: DISABLED
Boost enabled? (0 i disabled)
0

                    <p>Same for me, my settings don't get respected at all.

Running auto-cpufreq --stats even tells me my settings, but it enables turbo boost even when it is set to never and doesn't hold any limit on max cpu usage for powersave. Even after disabling tlp this still happens.

(This only happens if plugged in to power)</p>

Running tools similar to auto-cpufreq could potentially be a culprit for this problem.</p>

                    <p>In my case I had set my governor to performance and turbo to always when in charger and powersave and never in battery but for some reason, even though stats reported performance the cpu was not boosting properly at all. I game in a vm and I noticed the game getting stuck along with audio. I also noticed general performance be sluggish. Turning the setting back to auto for charger fixed it.

@tamimmahmudkhan in your case I would definitely let auto-cpufreq make the decisions. 

When I first created this tool I had in mind for it to automatically make all the decisions. Along the way, there were some people who thought that they could make better/overrule decisions that were made by auto-cpufreq, as originally reported in #26

That's how  [auto-cpufreq config file ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) came to be. Just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to use it, it's only there to potentially make your auto-cpufreq a better one.  </p>

Hello, 
I have Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with same AMD processorr (4700U). Can you tell me how I can check if auto-cpufreq is using lenovo specific settings such as Intelligent Cooling - Battery Saving or Extreme Performance? I`m using Zorin OS 16 which uses Ubuntu 22.4 if that makes any difference. I`m not so experienced in Linux sorry for newbie question :)</p>
