                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I'm not sure if there's been a breaking change in python but when built on arch linux the program doesn't seem to run as it doesn't display any stats using the --stats flag and throws this error when trying to check with the --monitor flag:

                    <p>The build process doesn't show any error, it only throws a couple of warnings about setup.py install and setuptools.installer being deprecated. Python version is 3.10.7</p>
