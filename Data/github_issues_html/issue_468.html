                <p>Hi there,
auto-cpufreq has been great for me to strangle my 5800HC CPU and stop it cranking up and wasting battery

I've got a suggestion/improvement I'd like you to consider, it's stated that cpu-autofreq uses and works best with the "balanced" power profile presumably referencing the setting in  /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile

Based on some benchmarks done by phoronix etc, battery life would be better with the low-power profile as in most cases this tells the laptops BIOS to conserve power, leveraging not software or drivers but actual firmware features to save power.

If this profile switcher was incorporated into cpu-autofreq's config so that for example, on battery low-power profile is set and on AC this is changed back to balanced, I think we'd see some further gains in power saving.

Is this something you could look into?

                    <p>While this sounds like an interesting option to have. Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>

None taken, it has really gotten to that point.</p>

                    <p>system76 and gnome power management tools use power profiles, and yes it is best to use that than manually tweaking stuff in /sys. However this feat is limited to some hw, usually newest machines.

                    <p>I would also love to allow configuring platform_profiles as well, since my laptop allows tweaking it, would love to push it to `performance` when charging and `low_power` when not plugged in </p>
