            <h1>Incorect python packages names on tumbleweed (installer needs update)</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #886</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>In the installation script there is a line for opensuse tumbleweed
zypper install -y python3 python3-pip python311-setuptools python3-devel gcc dmidecode gobject-introspection-devel python3-cairo-devel gtk3 gtk3-devel

But most python packages on opensuse tumbleweed requires precise python version, for example python313, instead of python3. So i searched for all packages like in line above and no all appeared (by the way instead of "pakiet" it should be package, i use polish version of tumbleweed, this is why this strange word appeared):

i+ | python311-setuptools        | Download, build, install, upgrade, and uninstall Python packages | pakiet

Maybe packages name should be named like belove (unfortunately i did not find a correct substitution for gtk3)?

mozartwa123@localhost:~> zypper search -x python313 python313-pip python311-setuptools python313-devel gcc dmidecode gobject-introspection-devel python311-cairo-devel gtk3 gtk3-devel

i  | python313-pip               | A Python package management system 

Of course, zypper install python3 could cause installation python313, but what if some functionality needs python311 package?

Maybe I should make a fork and pull request instead of issue, but I am afraid I would brake something.
Sorry, if it is duplicate.
Best regards, great job by the way!</p>
