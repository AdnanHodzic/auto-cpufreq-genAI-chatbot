                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Every time I close the laptop, it goes into sleep mode, although I set it to ignore in the config in Fedora 40. But since I use excellent software in the good sense of this understanding, I do not know where to disable this feature.</p>

                    <p>Sorry, but this has nothing to do with auto-cpufreq, so closing the issue.

                    <p>How does it not apply if your software replaces the power settings thereby maintaining the same sleep mode after removing it, everything becomes normal</p>

                    <p>`auto-cpufreq` does not touch system settings, so yes please provide more info if you really believe this is related to `auto-cpufreq`</p>
