                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed that after I suspended my computer turbo boost it doesn't become effective. Using --stats I see that turbo boost is on but frequency does not go up. This happens when I switch from charging to battery mode; not every time but it happened twice on the last day.
I installed auto-cpufreq via the GitHub method and I also tried to restart the demon by systemctl but nothing changed even if I changed the turbo setting via the config file.
What can I do? There is a log file that I can share for showing the error?</p>
