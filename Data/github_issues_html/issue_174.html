                    <p>@librewish  guess governor on charging has been fixed now, but it seems now it won't trigger turbo boost? </p>

                    <p>What people want is
 they want to scale frequency even on battery to performance 
While depending on load
When no load they want powersave</p>

Is this the expected behaviour on battery? cause the stats show turbo boost on so I thought that it would scale the frequency to handle the increased load.

A question though is the scaling frequency depended on the governor?</p>

                    <p>Yes frequency scaling is dependent on governor
Powersave governor always try to keep frequency at minimum even on highest load so you will never use your pc at its full or even half its potential 
While performance governor tries to keep frequency at maximum </p>

                    <p>Hmm then switching to conservative governor with load on battery would be more appropriate

                    <p>I was wondering if it'll be good to scale only  a few cores to higher performance governor for battery and performance?
will the operating system distribute more demanding tasks to the cores with higher frequencies? 

Edit: It doesn't assign heavy tasks to cores with higher performance governor.

But it would be nice if auto-cpufreq changed the governor on individual cores that are running at high usage like  > 80%</p>

                    <p>There was a discussion regarding this in #69, or to put one such setting to settings file #26. If we go down this route I'm of an opinion that this is done automatically based on i.e: really low cpu usage/uptime and on battery.

I'll change title of this bug/issue report, so I keep it in mind for future.</p>
