This is more of a general issue rather than a specific issue I'm encountering. I was going to make a PR that fixes this, but I'm not sure if there's a specific way you might want it done, so I figured I'd open an issue first at least.

The dinit service currently provided in the repo will not work without some work by the user. This is because dinit does not export any environment variables by default, and auto-cpufreq crashes when setting the PATH environment variable, because PATH does not exist at all.

The user can fix this issue without modifying the service by exporting PATH in /usr/lib/dinit/environment (I believe, that path is off the top of my head). Otherwise, there's 2 ways in my mind to go about fixing this:

1. In the actual code, check if PATH is in os.environ at all before accessing it with [], and define it if it does not, so that a KeyError doesn't occur. This is probably the best solution because it's more "general".
2. Change the dinit service to export PATH. This is the route I went - I'll put the files I created below.

/etc/dinit.d/auto-cpufreq:
```
type            = process
command         = /usr/lib/dinit/auto-cpufreq
```
<br>

/usr/lib/dinit/auto-cpufreq: (made executable!)

```shell
#!/bin/sh
export PATH=/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon
```</p>

I agree this is probably the best solution and would better cover future cases of this. If the PATH env var can't be found, it should be set to "/usr/local/bin". It would be great if you could open a PR for this.</p>
