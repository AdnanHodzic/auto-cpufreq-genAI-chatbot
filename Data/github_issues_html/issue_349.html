            <h1>Set Balanced mode on power-profiles-daemon</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #349</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When we disable the `power-profiles-daemon` if it's in "Power saver" mode, we can loose some performance. As it will not max out the turbo. As seen in the following tests below. 

We can only set this mode when the `power-profiles-daemon` is actually running. We always disable `power-profiles-daemon` on installation, and if it's running before we disable it, we first set it to "Balanced".

```stress --cpu 16 --io 4 --vm 4 --timeout 60``` after I installed `auto-cpufreq` when `power-profiles-daemon` was first set to "Power saver"

I did add the change to ```gnome_power_disable_live()``` but we don't actually use that at the moment. We currently only throw a warning to the user when in live mode.</p>

This is great, I'm doing the same thing I was doing today without these changes, and my computer was literally choking, now it's smooth sailing. 

I did notice some weird things, where when I ran: `stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 4 --timeout 60`, my frequencies were scaled down, then what they would be running at their "normal" workload which is in >= 2000Mhz range.

Let me know if you any other ideas, but Iet's merge these changes now as they definitely fix a major regression. Then I'll keep an eye on it and see if my frequencies keep getting scaled down under incredibly heavy low.

>I did add the change to gnome_power_disable_live() but we don't actually use that at the moment. We currently only throw a >warning to the user when in live mode.

We probably should start using it for live mode as well, as live should represent how system will behave after install. But I guess it can be done as part of separate change if necessary. 

**Update**

I forgot to add as part of this change it would be a good idea to have a check which verifies `powerprofilesctl` is present before proceeding.</p>

About that freqencies, I'm not sure, did you try use performance instead of balanced before disabling?
I did not test that, because I already maxed out my system on balanced.</p>

I did, but then I'm getting different errors like:

```
result = self.dbus_proxy.call_sync(self.method_name, arg_variant,
gi.repository.GLib.Error: g-dbus-error-quark: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Failed: Profile 'performance' is inhibited (0)
```

I think the reason for this is because I'm running on GNOME 40.4 and things are bit different when it comes to GNOME Power profiles, it's not like on 41 where you can switch between them. 

But I'll keep an eye on this and let's see if anyone else comes with this problem, as it's confirmed that running stress will scale down frequencies, but otherwise if load is not that high they'll spike above >2000Mhz which was rarely the case before. It also might be that auto-cpufreq is doing the scale down since it detected high temperatures, although it shouldn't in case CPU usage is above certain percentage.</p>

Found out that once it starts outputting `CPU fan speed: 0 RPM`, even auto-cpufreq daemon reinstall (first `--remove` followed by `--install`) won't fix it, and even after reboot it'll still display 0 RPM.

But, after I do `auto-cpufreq --remove` followed by reboot, and then do `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` again, 0 RPM will be outputed properly, example `auto-cpufreq --stats` output:

But it seems like it's not a problem after all as after I run: `stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 4 --timeout 90` to stress the CPU again to get those fans rotating, they will start rotating again. I just find it weird that they will shut off completely and so fast.

However, noticed something else and would like to hear if you're experiencing this problem. What we see from my last output, while my cores are all 100% used while they are being stressed, frequency of all of those cores is only set to 1400Mhz (max is 4600Mhz).

But if I install auto-cpufreq damemon using performance mode (`--install_performance`) then the cores will spike up and this is literally the reason why I introduced this mode, so I guess there might be no problem there either. It also seems like my fans never shut down in `--install_performance` (never went down below >= 2000 range), which makes sense as this mode is lot more aggressive and will use more power as [explained on ReadMe](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#1-power_helperpy-script).
