                    <p>Could you make a version of this tool for devuan and mx-linux?
Perhaps you can contact devs for those distros. So that, they can fork you for it to be available on their distros.
I am sure they will be interested in this wonderful tool.</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>You mean as a package or? Since both are Debian derivatives, this tool should work fine on both distros as is.

Similar suggestion was [raised on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ejxx9f/github_autocpufreq_automatic_cpu_speed_power/fd5bs67/), and what I'm planning to do is create a snap for this tool in next major release.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic What I mean is that Devuan and Mx-linux do not use systemd. So it won't work there. You can have a look on Devuan and Mx init system explanations</p>

                    <p>Ah right, okay I'll add ToDo item to implement ability for `auto-cpufreq` to also work without systemd.</p>

                    <p>Until this request is implemented, I would advise you to install [auto-cpufreq from a snap](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store) package.</p>

PCLinuxOS is also another distro that is free from systemd. There has been interest there in auto-cpufreq.

PLEASE, can there possibly be a systemd free version of auto-cpufreq?

                    <p>I do not have time to implement this feature, especially since I also don't use any of the mentioned distros.

But if any of you wants to implement this feature and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution), please do so! As I'd love to have improved non systemd support as part of auto-cpufreq.</p>

I would absolutely love it if these changes could merged with auto-cpufreq `master` branch.</p>

                    <p>hi i am running auto-cpufreq daemon mode without systemd. It seem to work fine (except for auto-cpufreq --install failed to install the  daemon service for me. It was nothingburger for me . I can do it manually. )  . (btw I dont expect it will work properly bc i am using it on arm.).

                    <p>any news on this? tried installing on artix recently with runit and the installer looks like it's trying to do the right things but not succeeding:

```
--------------------- Deploying auto-cpufreq as a daemon ----------------------

* Turn off bluetooth on boot [skipping] (package providing bluetooth access is not present)

* Deploy auto-cpufreq install script

* Deploy auto-cpufreq remove script

------------------ Running auto-cpufreq daemon install script ------------------

* Deploy auto-cpufreq runit unit file
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/etc/runit/sv/auto-cpufreq’: File exists
cp: cannot stat '/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts/auto-cpufreq-runit': No such file or directory
chmod: cannot access '/etc/runit/sv/auto-cpufreq/run': No such file or directory

* Creating symbolic link (/run/runit/service/auto-cpufreq -> /etc/runit/sv/auto-cpufreq)
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/run/runit/service/auto-cpufreq': File exists

* Stopping auto-cpufreq daemon (runit) service
ok: down: auto-cpufreq: 1s, normally up, want up

* Starting auto-cpufreq daemon (runit) service
timeout: down: auto-cpufreq: 8s, normally up

----------------- auto-cpufreq daemon installed and running -----------------

To view live stats, run:
auto-cpufreq --stats

To disable and remove auto-cpufreq daemon, run:
sudo auto-cpufreq --remove

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I reckon this is an Artix thing as Artix puts runit services in a different place (not /etc/runit/service, but /run/runit/service).</p>

                    <p>Support for Devuan is also supported, closing this issue.
