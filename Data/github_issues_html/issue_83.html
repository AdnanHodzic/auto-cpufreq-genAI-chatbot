I don't know if it's an error (translation), but according to auto-cpufreq (as I understand it), the battery is discharged even when it is plugged in. In my opinion the program can take bad values in boost management and so on (although I don't see that it would change anything).

Unless I'm stupid and I misunderstand something.</p>

                    <p>it seems that `psutil` doesn't recognize the battery state: `power_plugged=None`.
How did u install it, did u use snap?

BTW: didn't we met on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/i4zemd/new_release_autocpufreq_automatic_cpu_speed_power/g0m3epq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) (just recognized same CPU lol)? </p>

                    <p>Nope. I have MSI Alpha 15 with dual Radeon GPUs. That's why I bought it :P

I install AUR version, but snap also have this problem. Ofc. this is hipotetical problem, because everything works, but I don't know if the program will go into power-saving mode.</p>

                    <p>Oh, I see, than it's not due to the snap sandboxing.
So, there is same bug in the `psutil` upstream

                    <p>I'm running into roughly the same problem. I set my battery charge threshold to 80% using [asusctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl) for everyday use. And when used with power-profiles-daemon, the battery status is `Not charging` as expected. However, with `auto-cpufreq` it keeps changing between `Discharging` (thus dropping below 80%) and `Charging` (charges back to 80%).

I'm not sure if this is some sort of incompatibility between asusctl and auto-cpufreq.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>> I'm not sure if this is some sort of incompatibility between asusctl and auto-cpufreq.

I'm thinking there's a conflict between these two, as it is for example [GNOME power profiles or TLP](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script-snap-package-install-only) which auto-cpufreq works on disabling automatically or warning about them.

Since I don't know anything about asusctl, simple way to verify this problem is to disable it and see if yo still have the same problem with auto-cpufreq ...</p>

I tried, yet the problem was still around. However, it has got even weirder, that it occurs only when using USB PD adapter to charge. It doesn't trigger when using the vendor-provided power brick...

Now I suspect this is a firmware problem or so. Maybe `power-profiles-daemon` carries workaround for it?</p>

                    <p>I've made a change to the battery charging detection, you can install manually with `git clone https://github.com/Angel-Karasu/auto-cpufreq.git` and follow the installation guide, give a feedback if it's repare this problem or not</p>

The battery in your code have status "Not charging" however in CPU frequency scaling is an information:
Battery is discharging

Is this the result when the battery is charging ?
When you use fastfetch/neofetch, is the battery status correct ?</p>
