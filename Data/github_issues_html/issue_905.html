Should users of this software expect releases to be cut? Particularly for AUR – there's not been a new release in over 6 months. Should AUR be updated to use the latest commit on the default branch instead?</p>

                    <p>No that shouldn't be the case, please contact[ AUR auto-cpufreq package maintainers.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#aur-package-arch-based-distributions)

Also there should be a new big auto-cpufreq v2.7 released soon. 

Otherwise if you want latest changes I would advise you to get latest changes using repo and install it using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-cpufreq-installer) which also supports Arch.</p>

                    <p>Just to clarify, were you saying "No" to expecting releases to be regularly cut or "No" to switching the AUR package to building directly from the default branch? Your message isn't quite clear to me 😅</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I think using "release being cut" is what's confusing for me :) 

IIRC, AUR package releases are only made when new major auto-cpufreq release happen. [Last major release was 2.6.0](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which matches your 6 months timeframe. 

So, if you don't want to wait for major release to be made to get the latest changes, I suggest to use [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-cpufreq-installer) instead.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Not to just +1, but yes the AUR package currently follows the major releases. If current commit behaviour is desired, one could look into [`auto-cpufreq-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/auto-cpufreq-git)?</p>
