                <p>Extends #185

This is a desktop PC without battery. (Basically I am debugging a heat issue - throtteling the CPU would help.)

### Error output:
```text
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors'
```

However a similar file exists:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/available_governors

Is that an option?

Also can  you catch the exception and output some more user friendly information instead?

                    <p>With [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>

                    <p>Thanks for the update, I will try and report back.
(FYI: Those "heat issues" ar gone now on that particular machine, which is 15+ years now -> cleaning, apply fresh heat-flow paste etc. helped to reduce power consumption)

Do you think about moving auto-cpufreq into kernel (dkms?) instead of user space? (I know the question is off-topic here - and implies writing bloody C/Rust? code. From user's viewpoint though this would add so much value…)</p>

Good to hear.

I thought about it, but would first like to add few more features and then we can discuss the next steps for auto-cpufreq :)

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic Checked yesterday. I couldn't find any scaling governour so I guess the CPU/Mainboard is simply "too old" and doesn't have this feature. Don't have time to check that really.</p>
