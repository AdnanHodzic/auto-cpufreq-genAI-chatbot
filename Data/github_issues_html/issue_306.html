                    <p>Alright very nice. Now I would like the information of these two commands. One time when connected to the power chord and one time when you are on battery only. But please run the commands a few times first. So we are sure we have the right state.

`cat /sys/class/power_supply/ADP1/online`
`cat /sys/class/power_supply/CMB0/status`

Oh and I would like this one as well. When you run this, doesn't matter:
`cat /sys/class/power_supply/ADP1/type`
`cat /sys/class/power_supply/CMB0/type`
</p>

                    <p>Allright. First of all. uninstall the snap package from your system.

Then follow these steps. You will use my repo from github because it's not available here yet.

```
git clone https://github.com/bobslept/auto-cpufreq.git
cd auto-cpufreq
git checkout fix-charging-state
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
```
Now auto-cpufreq is installed. You can now use it in live mode to test the fix like this:
`sudo auto-cpufreq --live`

to remove all this from your system use the remove function from the installer:
`sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove`</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Gokul2003g:</strong></p>
                    <p>Awesome, thanks!
It is working now!!
Thanks for your help.
A personal question, Can you guide me to also contribute to open source and
get involved in development and share your personal experience? And share
some learning materials.
I am currently learning JAVA from codeacademy.com and learning web
development from freecodecamp.com.
For learning linux command I am using The Linux Command Line Book

Well about the contributing to open source. If you use some project from github. Look into issues that are open, but also issues that are closed. Read and learn how they fixed certain issues. Then try fixing some issue yourself locally and if you think you have fixed something, try to participate on that issue. Ofcourse it's easier to contribute to a project that uses programming languages that you know. Another tip, don't start to difficult. Sometimes you can already help if you spot a typo and fix that. Or write some documentation if you feel that is missing. I wish you the best of luck on your journey!

                    <p>Thanks to @bobslept the proposed changes have now been merged with `master` branch. Changes will be part of the upcoming 1.8.2 release.  

Until the release is made, changes can be installed by either having latest `master` changes and installing them using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto-cpufreq-installer) or using `beta` channel of Snap package (`sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta`). With that said I'm closing this issue, please re-open it if the issue persists.

@Gokul2003g if you look at issues for auto-cpufreq, there's a lot of easy to fix ones. If you fix some of them [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and that's an easy way to start contributing to open source :slightly_smiling_face: </p>
