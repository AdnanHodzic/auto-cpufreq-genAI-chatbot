            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Apologies for the mess in the last attempt I made lol. The rebase went horribly wrong.

Added a new section for the battery thresholds as discussed in #637 </p>

                    <p>Some thing you will want to add is  the stop charge threshold can not be below 65 ( at least with thinkpad_acpi ) I've had errors having it lower than 65

Edit: I'll try this test again just to make sure</p>

Hm, I can't find any documentation on this, so maybe this needs to be explored further?
Would you mind sharing the errors you get?</p>

                    <p>I started building a test however I won't be able to finish it until tonight I'll reply back with results </p>

                    <p>Maybe it would also be a good idea to first merge #645 ?</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Agreed.</p>

                    <p>#645 merged, added a few comments, nothing major other then that LGTM! 

Let's wait for @PurpleWazard to finish with:

> So it seems my test is working without issue so I'm going to do some investigating

and if he doesn't have any additional comments we're ready to merge.
</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>PurpleWazard:</strong></p>
                    <p>It all looks good to me @AdnanHodzic suggested that we clarify that --live doesn't call the battery functions. 
Is was because I had having issues when I ran --live with the battery functions however since I've rewritten the battery scripts I tested it with --live and I haven't had an issue.

I can add that change before or after the new release if needed</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@PurpleWazard I would rather have it before and hence part of 2.2.0 release. </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>PurpleWazard:</strong></p>
                    <p>It is done</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Removed this comment because this is now addressed with merge of #646

>Would also be good to include https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/645#issuecomment-1942159310. Maybe as a last line for this section to say something like: "Please note: only --monitor and --stats have battery threshold function"
>
>Or maybe it could be omitted, my only concern is that folks will ask it as a question. Alternatively it could be added as a comment for config file as part of battery threshold?

@shadeyg56 then let's add those 2 links I suggested and it's ready to merge.
