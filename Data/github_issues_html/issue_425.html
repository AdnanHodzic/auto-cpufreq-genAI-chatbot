### Have you tried?

- [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 
- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?
- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?
YES
- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?
YES

### Error output:
No error. But cpu freq goes to 1600 after suspend/resume for no reason although still in Powersave mode.

### System information:

Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

The expecpted beahviour is that the cpu stays at 800MHz after a suspend resume with no additional apps atrted etc. I just do suspend/resume and CPU freq goes from 800 to 1600.

                    <p>I now switched to TLP and had the same result: CPU does not go down to 800 after suspend/resume.

Then I found a post about cpufreq and intel_cpufreq and TLP and that was about disabling TLP and auto-cpufreq. Tha solved the problem.
I now have a system (Debian 11 XFCE) that switches the CPU correctly also after suspend /resume.

These are the left over running apps related to power and cpu:

```
$ps -A| grep -E "cpu|freq|pm|power"
