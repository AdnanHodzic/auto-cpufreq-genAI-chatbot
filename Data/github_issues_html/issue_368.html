            <p><strong>Issue #368</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have installed `auto-cpufreq` using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer) on a Lenovo Thinkpad X260 running Linux Mint 20.3. I have disabled the [intel_pstate](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting) driver.


Although it does seem to be running normally, I get an error message claiming that snap cannot be found when running `auto-cpufreq --stats`, `auto-cpufreq --debug` or `systemctl status auto-cpufreq`.

Linux Mint, unlike other Ubuntu derivatives, does not ship with snap.

Is snap required for this program to run? If not, is there a way to remove this message?

### Error output:
```
sh: 1: snap: not found
```
---

### Systemd service status:
#### Although the message does appear, the program continues to run normally. It can be seen running in `htop` as well.
```
$ systemctl status auto-cpufreq

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I've just pushed changes which will fix this problem and are on `snap_detect_improve` branch, it all works great on my side but could you also check that all works from your side as well before I merge this with `master`?

You can do this from dir you cloned auto-cpufreq to, i.e:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove
git fetch
git checkout snap_detect_improve
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
sudo auto-cpufreq --stats
```

Thanks</p>

                    <p><strong>ryouze:</strong></p>
                    <p>It does not seem to work on my end. I have tried reinstalling it several times. I have also rebooted my machine.
By "does not seem to work", I mean that the `sh: 1: snap: not found` message still appears.
Edit: typo.

If you have some time to spare, perhaps you could try testing it on [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) through VM since it is guaranteed to have no snap dependencies whatsoever. If not, please consider adding a `--no-snap` argument or a toggle to the interactive installer. That way, any issues with the automatic detection could be manually resolved by the user.

                    <p>> If not, please consider adding a `--no-snap` argument or a toggle to the interactive installer. That way, any issues with the automatic detection could be manually resolved by the user.

Thanks for suggestion, but it doesn't work like that, tool is smart enough to automatically detect which environment it's running in so no need to pass any arguments. This problem in particular was introduced as part of [1.9.2 release ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) and was even mentioned by @bobslept when I asked to test things as part of #361.

> If you have some time to spare, perhaps you could try testing it on [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) through VM since it is guaranteed to have no snap dependencies whatsoever. 

No I do not have any additional time to spare, as for months I've been looking for [co-maintaners/developers to help out with the workload this project requires](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions/312), which keeps falling on deaf ears.

Hence as always I encourage you and everyone else willing to address problem to [submit code contribution](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution), as this problem should be simple to fix, I just don't have enough time to properly look into it.
 
On `master` branch problem originates on line [287](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/power_helper.py#L287) and 303 of power_helper.py file. So when this line is evaluated on system that doesn't have snap installed it'll output `sh: 1: snap: not found` as it does in your case.

On `snap_detect_improve` branch [problem is on line 288](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/snap_detect_improve/auto_cpufreq/power_helper.py#L288) and 320. I tested the changes by running this code where I would replace `snap` with `snax` to emulate system where snapd is not present so I should be getting same errors you're getting, but I didn't run into any errors. 

In meantime I also commented following variables which were maybe getting evaluated and giving you that error again, 

```
#snap_pkg_install= os.system("snap list | grep auto-cpufreq >/dev/null 2>&1")
#snap_exist = os.system("snap >/dev/null 2>&1")
```

To verify if this fixes it make sure to do `git pull` on `snap_detect_improve` branch. 

Regardless, this is way more time I wanted to dedicate to this issue and I will be unable to make any further changes for some time. If you or anyone else wants to look into this problem and pick up where I left of in terms of changes and submit a PR as I pointed above as part of code contribution, I will be glad to look into it and further review it.</p>

                    <p>Hey, I'm on endeavourOs and i have the same issue and i don't have snap installed. What's worse is that when i do `sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq` , i can see that the script starts working but the service does not start itself after i reboot. I have to manually start it everytime to make it work.

Any idea why this is happening? </p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@default-303 why do you run `sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq` manually? When you run `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` it will automatically start the auto-cpufreq systemd service for you.

I'm already working on fixing the `sh: 1: snap: not found` but since I don't have this problem, can you help test the changes? You can confirm this by installing auto-cpufreq from `snap_detect_improve` branch?

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove
git fetch
git checkout snap_detect_improve
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
auto-cpufreq --stats
```

</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I just verified by running changes on `snap_detect_improve` branch freshly installed Fedora 35 on another laptop (no `snapd` in sight) and auto-cpufreq works just fine and there are  no `sh: 1: snap: not found`.  I also got confirmation issue was fixed in  #372.

I think @himitsuzero you didn't run pull the right changes or something, could you try again? @default-303 I'm also still waiting for your feedback. 

@bobslept as someone who I ultimately trust and who has been great contributor as of lately, could you please pull these changes and let me know if you're experiencing problem mentioned above? If you also confirm it to be working fine, I'll merge this with master and make it part of 1.9.3 release. Thank you</p>

Should I mark the issue as closed or let others confirm that the `snap_detect_improve` branch works for them as well?

No, I'll merge these changes and make a v1.9.3 release in next couple of days, once I've done that I'll close the issue and inform everyone in this issue this has happened. </p>
