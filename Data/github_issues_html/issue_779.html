The commit has a 2.4.0 tag, and the `--debug` command shows `auto-cpufreq version: 2.4.0`, so I suppose yes.</p>
                </div>

I solved uninstalling tuned. Now start the service in boot.  </p>

                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>I have the same issue after upgrading my workstation to Fedora 41, with Fedora 40 I've never observed such behavior.

The service does not longer start automatically after the reboot, even if the service is enabled:

```
$ systemctl status -l auto-cpufreq.service 
○ auto-cpufreq.service - auto-cpufreq - Automatic CPU speed & power optimizer for Linux
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/auto-cpufreq.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
    Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/service.d
             └─10-timeout-abort.conf
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

The service has to be started manually, not sure why.
```
$ sudo systemctl start auto-cpufreq.service
```

Perhaps the service is conflicting with some other service? 

From Fedora 41 [release notes](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/sysadmin/#tuned-def-pwr-mgmt-daemon), I see that TuneD replaced power-profiles-daemon as a default power profile management daemon, it might be related</p>

This also worked for me on fedora 41. Thanks!</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>Oh, I didn’t get the memo that Fedora switched to tuned.

However, completely removing tuned isn’t necessarily required, disabling the service is enough to let auto-cpufreq do its thing.

Perhaps power_helper.py could be adjusted to check for tuned and disable it as well? Additionally, it would be helpful to mention this in the README.

Many Fedora users would likely appreciate this addition.

I also changed the title of this issue so that if someone searches for the problem, it will be easier to identify the root cause and solution for them.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>clemenceaus:</strong></p>
                    <p>Is there any specific reason I would want to keep it? If its disabled all the time I can remove it aswell.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>> Perhaps power_helper.py could be adjusted to check for tuned and disable it as well? 

This would be the ideal solution, where new function would be created to stop tuned, [just as it is for GNOME Power Profiles.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/7b03630a5e094fc2ef58492d6be35bf64c387815/auto_cpufreq/power_helper.py#L96)

```
# stops gnome >= 40 power profiles (live)
def gnome_power_stop_live():
    if systemctl_exists and not bool(gnome_power_status) and powerprofilesctl_exists:
        call(["powerprofilesctl", "set", "balanced"])
        call(["systemctl", "stop", "power-profiles-daemon"])
```

and then this function would be called [when auto-cpufreq is installed.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/7b03630a5e094fc2ef58492d6be35bf64c387815/auto_cpufreq/bin/auto_cpufreq.py#L96)

```
gnome_power_detect_install()
gnome_power_stop_live()
tlp_service_detect()
```

> Additionally, it would be helpful to mention this in the README.

After this was implemented I would definitely mention it in README, just as it is for [GNOME Power Profiles ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#installing-auto-cpufreq) or [TLP and etc](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#why-do-i-need-auto-cpufreq).

Since I'm not experiencing problem because I'm not using Fedora, @danee940 or **anyone else** would like to give it a try and implement this feature by simply making small code changes. I encourage you to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

Of course as part of this PR, [create function to enable tuned back](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/7b03630a5e094fc2ef58492d6be35bf64c387815/auto_cpufreq/power_helper.py#L106) in case [auto-cpufreq daemon is removed](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/7b03630a5e094fc2ef58492d6be35bf64c387815/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L373C5-L373C27), just as it is for GNOME Power Profiles.</p>

                    <p>Hello,

I installed auto-cpufreq with the last source code on Fedora 41. The installation is working but I can"t enable the daemon through the gui or via cli. Can you help me ? is there a way to have a flatpak package ?

Thanks.

                    <p>@Tuxman2 flatpak was already asked in https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/125 & https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/71. Having a Flatpak is not possible due to its limitations as explained in that issue.

Changes which address this issue for Fedora were merged as [mentioned above,](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/779#issuecomment-2453041930).

If you have latest changes from source, make sure to follow instructions [how to install auto-cpufreq daemon](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon), and if problem persists please submit a new issue with more info.</p>
