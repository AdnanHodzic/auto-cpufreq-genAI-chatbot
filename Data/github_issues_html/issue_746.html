                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>FYI: I have opened an issue against nixpkgs, as I think it is there related, but that other can find it quicker, I link it here.
Everything is described here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/328374</p>

                    <p>It was not a problem with the unstable nixpkgs channel. The problem was that the pyintoify was updated in nixpkgs/unstable and got an patch. This patch does not work with the older version, that is used here.</p>
