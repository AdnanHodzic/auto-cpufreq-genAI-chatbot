                <p>My son has a laptop from system76 with PopOs. He want to install auto-cpu freq but when he does that he gets this error

Failed to start power-profiles-daemon.service: Unit power-profiles-daemon.service not found.

Someone told me there are missing dependencies. So my son installed power-profiles-daemon but then he gets another error. See picture.
