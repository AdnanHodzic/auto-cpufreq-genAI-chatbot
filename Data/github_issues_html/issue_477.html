                    <p>Yes, it was already mentioned [on README](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#aur-package-archmanjaro-linux). But I just pushed another change to make it even more explicit that it's not maintained.

Closing the issue ... </p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I was planning to maintain the Aur then I noticed that `auto-cpufreq-git` is working as expected and fine.
There are a few things the user has to keep in mind if installing from aur.

If facing `psutil` error: 
> Make sure pip version of psutil is not installed in system. Either install it via aur `python-psutil` or let the `auto-cpufreq-git` install it.

The user does not require to use the command `auto-cpufreq install` as the aur version installs it already.
The user just need to enable the system service. `sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq`.</p>

Awesome! I also re-opened the issue if that's the case :slightly_smiling_face:

Can't you just install `python-psutil` as part of dependencies for AUR?

Yea, I remember that being part of discussion #84, which is fine then we just note that as part of Readme? </p>

`python-psutil` is a part of dependencies in the AUR.
The installation throws error if user have already installed `psutils` from pip.

Yep, should add it in Readme.</p>

Ah, not sure in AUR packaging, but if possible as it is for Debian i,e as part of `Pre-Depends` to do some kind of custom bash logic to check if pip version is installed and if it is to remove it. As auto-cpufreq-installer will install it to a Python virtual env and system wide, so it won't be coming from here.</p>

                    <p>Since AUR is nowadays fully maintained, if you have any questions please feel free to contact one of the AUR maintainers: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#aur-package-arch-based-distributions</p>
