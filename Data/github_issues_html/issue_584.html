                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>One of the image links to a YouTube video wasn't properly formatted, so I fixed that and also went through the entire README making recommended adjustments to the text.

Some of my adjustments are important (in my opinion), others are just a matter of taste. Regardless, please feel free to reject any of them that don't appeal to you. If you're deeply curious as to why I made a particular change, feel free to ask and I'll attempt to explain my reasoning. Thank you for creating this tool and for considering my "improvements" to the README!</p>

                    <p>LGTM! Re-read through all of it I agree with all of it :) 

Could you please resolve the conflict (new changes were made to `README.md`) and I'll merge your changes with `master`. </p>
