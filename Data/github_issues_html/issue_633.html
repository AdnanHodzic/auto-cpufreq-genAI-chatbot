I saw my min processor speed was still a bit high. I did the troubleshooting step on my grub file (https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting) but that didn't seem to make a difference. Any suggestions? Apologies if I missed anything. Thanks in advance!

                    <p>`acpi-cpufreq` only exposes a few frequencies that can be used. To find the minimum you can run `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq`
To get a list of them all, run `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/scaling_available_frequencies`</p>
