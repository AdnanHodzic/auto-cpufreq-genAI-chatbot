                <p>Hi,

first of all: Thank you for creating `auto-cpufreq`, I really like it and prefer it to more invasive alternatives like TLP.

I'm fairly new to Linux power management and just found out about the `energy_perf_bias` value for Intel processors (see <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#Intel_performance_and_energy_bias_hint>).

Currently, it is set to the default value of `6` on my system although `auto-cpufreq` set the governor to `performance`.
I wonder if setting the value to `0` has the potential to further improve performance? If so, would it make sense to include such a feature in `auto-cpufreq`?</p>

                    <p>Could be an interesting thing to have ... since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>
