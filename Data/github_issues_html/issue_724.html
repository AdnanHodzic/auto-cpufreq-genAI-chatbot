First of all I would like to acknowledge the fact that there have been multiple issues opened for this same problem, like #138 , #661 and #563 

From what I gathered from those threads, this issue has been patched for Intel CPUs. But I'm using an AMD CPU and this issue is still present. And I might have a lead as to why this is happening. On Intel CPUs, having HWP active caused this issue and was patched in #147 . And it was later found that `intel_pstate` supports only the `performance` EPP when the governor is set to `performance` which was patched in #680 . And I have a feeling its the exact same issue on `amd_pstate` as well. When the governor is set to `performance`, only `performance` EPP is available as you can see in the screenshot below. By default auto-cpufreq tries to set `balance-performance` which might be causing this issue because such an EPP is not available.

So I think adding a patch similar to #680 but for `amd_pstate` this time, can be the fix for this issue. After this discussion, if this fix seems viable, I can send a PR.

                    <p>This code has an issue where if you use governor power and want to use other epp, you cannot change it while charging. Could you please fix this?</p>
