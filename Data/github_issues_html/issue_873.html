                <p>is there a way to make it so that auto-cpufeq doesn't turn off display no matter how much time passes? I would love to do this in the future for certain emulators such as this:

                    <p>auto-cpufreq has nothing to do with this app and shouldn't affect it in any way. Dimming has to do with how you configured your system.

Also closing due to ignoring to fill out issue template.</p>
