                <p>## bug report

**tl;dr** `pip completion --bash` now fails with permission denied after installing auto-cpufreq (see below on how I installed). I'll post back here when I have more.

I'm guessing this is an easy fix, so I'm planning on coming back later with a pull request (assuming I figure out what the installer did that was not-quite-right). Figured I should log this bug regardless - in case I don't get around to this for a while. I'm assuming:
- there was _previously_ some package-installed library that `pip completion` utilized (and so `pip completion --bash` ran fine in my `~/.bashrc` until now)
- this project's install script force-reinstalled its own dependency less elegantly (eg not "other"-executable), and now `pip completion` runs into issue.

okay I read the install script a bit more carefully and indeed this^ hunch was right, we're just running `sudo pip` which this article outlines nicely as a recipe for conflict with my own system's package manager: https://www.getpagespeed.com/server-setup/do-not-run-pip-as-root

NOTE: I've now found more things broken by this (even `less` - using a syntax highlighter that's worked for years - is now broken).

@AdnanHodzic Might I recommend [just stopping anyone from running this script][emergencyStopgap] until the correct installation method is devised? We can do that here, and leave this issue open, but I want to keep others from borking their machine. To clarify my thinking: I'm kind of lucky that I have a backup of my system files, so I'm going to spend some time very carefully rolling back later today or tomorrow (to just before this use of auto-cpufreq), but I **don't** think we'd want to reasonably rely on that, particularly if we know we have a script here doing something _well documented_ as causing pain (running `pip install` as root).

I thought I'd find some shell scripting that moved some python files around, but I see the problem is just the [`pip` being run as root](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/433c48b93d844a8459528e5955f9ae5d72a75c61/auto-cpufreq-installer#L31). I'm not a python developer, so have extremely little familiarity with best practices for python.

Yeah, pipenv sounds like the right track - it seems that the article's author created [something called `pip-safe`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-safe/) which seems related. Again I'm not a python developer, so really in over my head, but even before this article I'm easily bumping into people saying **not** to run pip outside of a virtualenv ([_"It's rarely a good idea to `pip install <package>` outside of a virtualenv."_](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54351636/287374)).

No worries, I took your feedback in best possible way and thank you for very valuable input @jzacsh :)

I'm not a python developer, so have extremely little familiarity with best practices for python.

When I started this project I was thinking what would be the best and most unified way to have it packaged. Even as someone who is ex Debian package maintainer, I naively thought that packing it [as a Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store) would solve all my problems and every distro could use it as such. As it's running in complete isolation (strictly confined) in a container. 

However, around this same time I realized I needed workaround (temporary) solution for those distros that didn't support Snap. Long story short, it's just amazing how temporary solutions end up becoming permanent.

I was aware of this from beginning, but since tool relies on root permissions so heavily I accepted going with this implementation hoping that most people would install it either as a [Snap](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store) or [AUR](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#aur-package-archmanjaro-linux) package. This Github project has over 1000 stars and a lot of installs across the board but this went undetected until now :)

I also absolutely don't want to interfere or break anyone's setup. As if we go down this path, we need to come up with an alternative solution for current implementation fast, and I'm really tight with time ATM. 

My addendum to your proposal would be is to display a re-phrase [a message a bit](https://github.com/jzacsh/auto-cpufreq/commit/51824fea9cd253d8075f8d617b30de7ac0603363) and encourage people to either use Snap/AUR until installer itself has been refactored, offering them to proceed with installer at their own risk. If they accept, installation continues, if not it exits as originally proposed.

Thanks for heads up, I wasn't aware of `pip-safe`. For other projects I used `pipenv` with great results.

Either way, looking forward to hearing your thoughts.</p>

If you had it installed successfully, then it had to be working as intended.

Reason why there isn't a flatpak is due to its limitations, see #71 for more info

Good to know. I'm trying to figure if #203 and #201 are related to this, although it seems like they are. As if they are not, and your problem originates from setting umask, maybe it's best to do nothing with installer until its replacement with pipenv (or something else) is here.

Regarding "something else" category I just idea how to solve this problem in most seamless/easy way. Simply install necessary Python libraries using apt instead of pip ....  which is what I was thinking about originally, but back then apt package with same libraries were much older then they are with pip and that's the reason I went with pip.</p>

I made my comment based on the fact that the battery status wasn't detected (see my `history` output in original report) - but perhaps that's not a sign that something was broken.

Ok, I'll hold off further commits on that pr then.

Oooh, +1 I'll test this (without any system setup) when I'm back at desk .. (I'll just run `python3 ./auto_cpufreq/core.py` directly and see if it's obvious what packages might be needed).</p>
