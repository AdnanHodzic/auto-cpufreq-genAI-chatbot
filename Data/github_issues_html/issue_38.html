            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I just installed auto-cpugreq from AUR on Manjaro and decided to use --install after I tested it live, however I'm getting this output

```
[~] sudo auto-cpufreq --install

--------------------- Deploying auto-cpufreq as a daemon ----------------------

* Turn off bluetooth on boot

* Deploy auto-cpufreq as system wide accessible binary
cp: cannot stat 'auto-cpufreq.py': No such file or directory

* Deploy auto-cpufreq install script
cp: cannot stat 'scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh': No such file or directory

* Deploy auto-cpufreq remove script
cp: cannot stat 'scripts/auto-cpufreq-remove.sh': No such file or directory
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/auto-cpufreq-install: No such file or directory
```
I've been trying to search for the file "auto-cpufreq-remove.sh" with no results at all.</p>

                    <p>Since I didn't write the AUR package myself but it was done by a contributor @crian, and since there was a similar problem in [#23](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/23) you might want to [install `auto-cpufreq` from source](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#get-auto-cpufreq-source-code).

And then simply installing [necessary packages using pip](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#requirements-installation-for-all-other-linux-distributions).

In meantime, I'm working on creating a snap which will help with unify installation on every distribution out there.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic Thanks for the reply, your suggested solution worked without any hick ups! Thanks.</p>
