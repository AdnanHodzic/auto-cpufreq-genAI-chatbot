            <h1>Problem | ARCH | Thinkpad with Intel Graphics appears to only stay in powersave governor mode when running on battery </h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #226</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When using only using battery power on my Thinkpad T450 (Ivy Bridge CPU) in EndeavorOS (Arch Linux) I noticed no matter what load I am applying to the laptop (e.g. playing a 4K video) I notice the laptop will stay in  "Setting to use: "powersave" governor" and stay at a speed of "798 MHz" where turbo does turn on. 

When the laptop is plugged into power I will see it switch to "Currently using: performance governor" ramp up to speed of "2195 MHz".

The problem is the laptop in battery mode with the slower CPU speed will make it unusable under load (where video will just play audio and video just pauses). 

I am at a loss at why the speed is stuck "798 MHz". The articles I sourced below appear to say that the new 'powersave' mode used by the Intel_pstate driver is dynamic for persons using Kernel 5.7 or higher. As I used TLP, I have included this file for review. Thank you.

Could you please give this a try as I believe it will resolve your problem. If it doesn't please feel free to re-open this issue.</p>

                    <p>Hi Adnan,

Thanks for your feedback. I did try using ACPI-CPUFreq which was referenced in your Read.me and the two below sources: 

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#cpupower
https://silvae86.github.io/2020/06/13/switching-to-acpi-power/

Add the “intel_pstate=disable” to the “GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT” configuration line.

```
FROM:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=“resume=UUID=715c2972-1a51-4d73-89a0-86ea7bb5aa7f resume_offset=3127296… apparmor=1 lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor”

TO:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=“resume=UUID=715c2972-1a51-4d73-89a0-86ea7bb5aa7f resume_offset=3127296… apparmor=1 lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor intel_pstate=disable”
```

Unfortunately after I switched to ACPI-CPUFreq from intel_cpufreq I noticed Auto-CPUFreq would only change the govenor to 'powersave' on battery and 'performance' on AC. So no inbetween states. Testing with CPUPower I was able to switch to the various governor states manually.

My workaround now with Kernel 5.7+ kernels is I am now using TLP alone where I use 'Ondemand' for battery and 'Performance' for AC Power.

I created some details notes of my testing (just in case you have some recommendations) in the EndeavourOS forms:

                    <p>Sorry, I just re-read what this issue is about.

Problem you're facing is that auto-cpufreq was made not to go to `powersave` governor while plugged in to power source, hence it'll only stay in this mode when on battery.

This use case fits most users needs. However, once long planned feature to have a settings file #26 is implemented, you will be able to override this (default) behavior. </p>

                    <p>Hi Adnan,

No issue. I tend to write allot of detail in my tickets. Pretty much my **usecase** was:

_Play the following 4k Video while running **on battery** (without it dropping frames). It would require that the CPU not be restricted to the Batterysave governor only, but ramp up Ondemand (or appropriate setting)._

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNtJ4HdMavo

My original setup with Auto-CPUFreq was **Manjaro Gnome on Kernel LTS 5.4** where I believe Auto-CPUFreq was able to change my governor settings while in battery mode (I could be wrong as I am not always on battery when I am testing).

The new setup  on the same laptop with Auto-CPUFreq is **EndeavourOS Gnome on Kernel LTS 5.10** where TLP service is disabled and Auto-CPUFreq was able to change my governor settings to:

Battery = Powersave
AC - Performance

Since on battery I am stuck at Powersave which restricts the CPU frequencies (turbo turns on) the video will pause or lose audio sync. 

**Note:**
* My setup has hardware acceleration configured (Vaapi) in Firefox and Chromium.
* I have considered switching to Kernel LTS 5.4, but this is kind of a pain as I would have to get it via the AUR and compile it everytime the kernel receives a patch.

This was an article I was reading as I was trying to learn your implementation better. Thought it might interest you as Phoronix always has some interesting points of view with testing to back it up.

                    <p>With [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks</p>

                    <p>Thanks for the feedback Adnan. I'm going to close this issue for now and will revisit with v1.7.0 release after I finish my KDE test project.</p>
