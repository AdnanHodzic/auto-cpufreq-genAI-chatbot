Yes. I have not seen this error.

I installed from the AUR using paru. Installation is successful.

I currently have auto-cpufreq version 2.4.0-1. It has been working since a few months back, but now it fails to start.

The auto_cpufreq daemon has been down since the 26th of december, but I do not see any update in my logs, so it could be an environment/pyhton issue. I am using python 3.13.1.  Many python packages where updated the 22nd, so I see no issue here. Then the 25th and 26th I updated these python packages:

```
[2024-12-25T12:36:45+0100] [ALPM] upgraded python-zstandard (0.23.0-1 -> 0.23.0-2)
[2024-12-26T22:16:37+0100] [ALPM] upgraded python-cleo (2.2.1-2 -> 1:2.1.0-1)
[2024-12-26T22:16:37+0100] [ALPM] upgraded python-poetry-core (1.9.0-6 -> 1.9.1-1)
[2024-12-26T22:16:37+0100] [ALPM] upgraded python-poetry (1.8.4-2 -> 1.8.5-1)
[2024-12-26T22:16:37+0100] [ALPM] upgraded python-termcolor (2.4.0-3 -> 2.5.0-1)
```

I have tried to reinstall with no success. Installation through the AUR seems successful but the issue persists.

I have tried to install the package manually, although I believe this should never work

```
$ sudo pipx install auto_cpufreq
Fatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:
    /root/.local/state/pipx/log/cmd_2025-01-14_21.10.58_pip_errors.log

Some possibly relevant errors from pip install:
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement auto-cpufreq (from versions: none)
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for auto-cpufreq

Error installing auto-cpufreq.
```

Also, auto_cpufreq is of course not in the packages list. `$ pip list | grep auto_cpufreq` shows no output.</p>
