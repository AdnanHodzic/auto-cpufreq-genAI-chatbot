                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi all,
I added the detection of the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed distribution to the installer script as I'm using a laptop with it and I wanted to install auto-cpufreq.

I used this commit to install it, it shouldn't give problems to others using the same distro.</p>

                    <p>Hi @NJOYSoftware, first of all thank you for your contribution.

I'll merge these changes, but could you please consider extending this condition match beyond just "opensuse-tumbleweed? Wouldn't it be better if it worked with any OpenSuse version?

Example:

```
[ $ID == "opensuse-tumbleweed" ];
```
matching was more like:
```
[ $ID == "opensuse*" ];
```

Thanks,

Adnan</p>

I would say so, but I don't know if any opensuse distro would install the software in this way, so I didn't want to commit something that I don't know it works smoothly. In the next days, I'll setup a VM with opensuse leap to check whether it works the same or not, and I can make a new PR.

Thank you for merging my commit!</p>

Good thinking, sure take your time and I'll be looking forward to any future PR you may have.
