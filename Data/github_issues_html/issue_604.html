            <h1>[FEATURE] Please allow to turn turbo on and off via override</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #604</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>- Searched open issues, this one does not seam to exist yet

Please, add the following commands:
```
sudo auto-cpufreq --force=turbo-boost on
sudo auto-cpufreq --force=turbo-boost off
sudo auto-cpufreq --force=turbo-boost auto
``` 
For me, normally I want turbo-boost to be on, but if the battery is below 40% or I go on  a long trip it shall be off.

                    <p>Yes, having this option/flag could be of great value. @shadeyg56 in GUI on/off/auto could maybe be selected using drop down menu.

Until I or someone else has time to look into developing this feature, if you want to give it a try please feel free to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

Please note that this is already possible to set by using [auto-cpufreq config file](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file).

```
# turbo boost setting. possible values: always, auto, never
turbo = auto
```

Besides Readme I also cover its functionality as part of [auto-cpufreq v2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPGpkZ0AZVU&t=608s).</p>

                    <p>>  GUI on/off/auto could maybe be selected using drop down menu.

Works for me, but needs to be implemented in the CLI first.

I also think it would be better to have it as its own flag instead of using the force flag so something like
`sudo auto-cpufreq --turbo=on`,`sudo auto-cpufreq --turbo=off`, `sudo auto-cpufreq --turbo=auto`</p>

                    <p>Yes, it should def be its own/new flag.</p>

                    <p>Do you have any idea why it reports that the Ryzen 7 7840U only supports a max frequency of 3300 MHz? I noticed that if using the amd-pstate-epp driver it does report 6600 MHz which is also not correct from my understanding. But it is matching the output of
