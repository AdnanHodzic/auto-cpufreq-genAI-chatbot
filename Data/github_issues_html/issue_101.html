                <p>Tried everything mentioned on the front page but nothing does.
can't get the app to work on OpenSuse.
Possible I have a work around ?
Please note that I'm not a fan of snap or flatpack I do prefer native apps.

Thanks !</p>

                    <p>You tried the [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer) right?</p>
