            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello, I've been using auto-cpufreq for a while now and it works fine. But recently when I checked `auto-cpufreq --stats` it incorrectly displays the number of CPU core I have on my computer. I have an AMD ryzen 5 5500U processor which has 6 cores and 12 threads. But the stats says it is 16. It also mentions disabled CPUs from 12 to 15.
It doesn't seem to affect the functionality of the program but the count is incorrect. output of  `--debug` is provided below

Hello, thanks for the reply. My current kernel is not built with amd_pstate. Im holding back on using it since it still need some work from what I have read.

That said, I looked at the source code of auto-cpufreq and saw the command used for getting the number of cores is nproc --all. On my machine, running this command returns 16 and there is a file /sys/devices/system/cpu/offline which contains 12-15. This means it's probably not an issue with auto-cpufreq and something to do with my machine.

I've created a forum discussion over at archlinux and there are others with the similar nproc output as mine. I can post the update here if there is any progress on this. Or since it is not related to this program, I can close this issue if that is needed</p>

This used to be handled differently with psutil Python library, but it was changed in meantime IIRC.

Either way, if you have an idea how to improve this please consider making [code contribution](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution)! </p>

                    <p>We're looking up the number of cores using ["nproc --all"](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/8fbb5ea624071c781c29eea731ff645c59d75b47/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L1075). It seems like that command is returning the number of threads and not cores. I think just a plain `nproc` should do the trick.

On my Intel i7-8550U I get
```
$ nproc --all
8
```
(which is correct)

On my AMD Ryzen 7 3700U I get
```
$ nproc --all
16
```
(which is incorrect)

A plain `nproc` with no parameters shows 8 on both my systems (which is correct).

The GNU help for nproc says
```
‘--all’
     Print the number of installed processors on the system, which may
     be greater than the number online or available to the current
     process.  The ‘OMP_NUM_THREADS’ or ‘OMP_THREAD_LIMIT’ environment
     variables are not honored in this case. 
```I think there might be some tech debt in nproc that freely mixes the terms processors/cores/units/threads.</p>

                    <p>@PROBUBBLE01 changes made in #423 by @zoitrok have been merged with `master`, could you pull the latest changes and confirm if everything works as expected now? Thanks!</p>

                    <p>running plain `nproc` on my system returns the number of threads, which is 12. Looked up the specification of @zoitrok 's CPUs , both of them has 4 cores and 8 threads, but `nproc`  and  `nproc --all` returns 8 on the intel CPU while on AMD, `nproc --all`  returns 16 and `nproc` returns 8.

I'm not sure if `nproc` deals with AMD and intel CPUs differently but it is visible that on AMD CPUs, `nproc --all`  returns wrong count. #423 does the job, everything looks good and works as expected.  Also, can confirm, latest changes returns 12 as the CPU count and `disabled CPUs` are gone.</p>
