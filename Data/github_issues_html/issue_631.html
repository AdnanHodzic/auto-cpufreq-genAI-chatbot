            <h1>Fix dynamic boosting being incorrectly diagnosed</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #631</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Previously, `auto-cpufreq` would only check if the `intel_pstate/hwp_dynamic_boost` file existed to determine if EPP was supported. This didn't account for the fact that the file's contents could be `0`, so it incorrectly assumed dynamic boosting was enabled.</p>

                    <p>Looks like too much was removed in terms of `energy_performance_preference`. Because now when I do `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` I end up with following error:

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --install
Traceback (most recent call last):

                    <p>There we go. It was my first time programming Python, ever, so forgive for that.

Anyway, tested on my machine as well (didn't know that was possible, was a GUI user) and it works now.

By the way, the two issues I faced were:
1. Boolean literals are `True` and `False`, not `true` and `false`.
2. Indentation (more specifically, BECAUSE OF A SINGLE WHITESPACE CHARACTER, my code refused to compile).</p>

                    <p>LGTM! It's to good to have EPP showing up again on Intel hardware, thank you for your contribution, you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

                    <p>@PhoenixCausesOof are you able to see EPP on intel in `--monitor` related to my [comment](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/641#issuecomment-1938971221) in #641 </p>
