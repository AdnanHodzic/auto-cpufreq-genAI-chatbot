            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>According to [file-hierarchy(7)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/file-hierarchy.7.en), `/usr` (except for `/usr/local`) should contain _Vendor-supplied operating system resources_ i.e. shall be managed by the package manager and the package manager only. Runtime-generated files like `cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` should be installed to `/usr/local/bin`.

After some investigation, I think the biggest problem is that a part of the installing/removing logic is in `core.py`, which makes little sense as those should mostly be handled by the package manager. I think the best approach is to make `core.py` only contain the real _core_ functionalities. And files like `cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` can just be left to downstream packagers instead of being generated at runtime. If manual installation is required, an _independent_ installation script could be used. But such change is huge and would take some time. If this is desired, I'd like to take part in as well :)</p>

Agreed, this was my idea with `core.py` but then development went too fast with too little time to refactor things and here we are now :)

Good point, I'll make sure to include this issue besides #460 for v1.9.7 release notes</p>
