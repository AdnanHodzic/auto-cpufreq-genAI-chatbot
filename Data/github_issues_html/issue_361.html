            <p><strong>Issue #361</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>[Issue described](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/359#issuecomment-1030686772) as part of #359.

@bobslept instead of hijacking #359 I've made this as a separate issue. 

I made changes as part of [max_performance](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/max_performance) branch which address above mentioned problem. What I did can best described in newly added section of README [Configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/max_performance#configuring-auto-cpufreq). 

I might be bit over engineered, but this setup works for both auto-cpufreq installer and Snap packages. Since you originally made power-profiles-daemon `balanced` related changes as part of #349, I wanted to hear if you have any additional comments/suggestions before I merge this with `master`.</p>

                    <p>I just found out with current code changes on `max_perfromance` branch, this works perfectly if Snap package is installed. 

However, if auto-cpufreq was installed using auto-cpufreq-installer,  when `sudo python3 power_helper.py --gnome_power_enable` is run so `sudo python3 power_helper.py --gnome_power_disable performance` can be run. 

Immediately after `--gnome_power_enable` is run, auto-cpufreq will stop working. Only way to make it work would be when this parameter is run to kill `/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/python /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon`, or `auto-cpufreq --remove`. Then after `--gnome_power_disable performance/balanced` is run to run `/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/python /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon` again or `auto-cpufreq --install`.

Currently I'm more aligned towards stopping/starting `/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/python /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq --daemon`. Only concern that I have is I don't know if this will work with AUR package.</p>

                    <p>Yeah it seems to work on my end. With me starting the service by hand again. If you stop/start it via systemctl it would work on aur packages to.

I'm not sure how it works out when performance mode is not available on the system. </p>

Problem I have is as soon as I manually or in code as part of function start auto-cpufreq service, if running power-profiles-daemon automatically gets stopped/disabled. Hence this is making it very hard to implement on non Snap-ed installs.

I'd make additional check for this before proceeding with performance. </p>

                    <p>@bobslept I just pushed changes which should work great on both snap and non snap installs. I revamped how (`systemctl`) services are detected/enabled/disabled and I made few more checks (i.e if performance governor is present) and improvements.

Please take a look/give it a run and let me know if it works well on your side, as I want to make a release with these changes tomorrow.

Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Just ran `max_performance` branch.

Seems to work on my end. Running `auto-cpufreq --install` will install with balanced profile and `auto-cpufreq --install_performance` will install with performance profile.

Only now `auto-cpufreq --stats` will ask for a password from sudo, if ignored it will just show the stats.

The line above seems to be responsible for that behavior. Which is run at all times when the `power_helper.py` is imported or used as standalone script. 

If I use it as standalone script, which needs sudo already, I'm getting error that snap command is not found. 
`sudo: snap: command not found`

After looking a bit closer I also see the snap not found message in other places, which totally make sense ofcourse. On `--install` or `--remove` for example.

Other than that, I didn't notice any problems.</p>

 I've removed `sudo` from mentioned line.

because of `>/dev/null 2>&1` part of that line none of that should be returned. During testing as part of development process I purposely misspelled `snap` which should return similar type of behavior (as i.e: `sna` doesn't exist), but it all worked fine and condition was still as it was supposed to be.

Great, thanks for testing it on your side again. [v1.9.2 has been released](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) which closes this issue.</p>
