                <p>Using /usr/local/bin/ will make this Fedora silverblue compatible. Currently I am unable to install it on my laptop.</p>

                    <p>Hi @gimbles glad you made it work, could you please [make a code contribution](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution) so we have auto-cpufreq also working on Silverblue? I think it could be simple as just adding case for silverblue as part of [auto-cpufreq-install.sh](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/scripts/auto-cpufreq-install.sh)

Thanks!</p>
