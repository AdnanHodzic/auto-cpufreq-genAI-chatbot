I'm having trouble installing and using auto-cpufreq on my Ubuntu 22.04.2 system. I followed the instructions on the auto-cpufreq GitHub page.

 I \ tried installing the package manually and from snap using the instructions on the GitHub page, but I'm still encountering issues when trying to run the auto-cpufreq command. Specifically, when I run the command `auto-cpufreq --install`, I get an error message that says "`Must be run root for this functionality to work, i.e: sudo auto-cpufreq`". And When I run `sudo auto-cpufreq` as suggested, I get an error message that says "`auto-cpufreq: wrong invocation.`"
 
 I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or how to fix this issue. thanks!

                    <p>I'm closing this issue as invalid, first you didn't fill out issue template as you should've. Second issue you're encountaring, it clearly states what you need to do:

```
Must be run root for this functionality to work, i.e: 
sudo auto-cpufreq
```

So you need to run `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` to install auto-cpufreq. 

Template issue ignored and not filled out, hence making this issue invalid, closing. Feel free to re-open this issue with properly filled out requested fields.
