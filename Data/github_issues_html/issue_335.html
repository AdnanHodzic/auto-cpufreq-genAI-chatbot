                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I read the *Troubleshooting* section and my Pop OS does not have **Grub** to disable.

This seems like a specific Pop OS problem which isn't really related to auto-cpufreq or its functionality. </p>

                    <p>@DanielAbrante, if you still interested (or if someone have the same issue): Pop_os uses systemd-boot instead of GRUB, so you have to configure it to disable intel_pstate. Path to boot config file in my case looks like `/boot/efi/loader/entries/Pop_OS-current.conf` - may vary depending on your partitions scheme.</p>

I am stuck at the same stone block, so what is the usage / command to switch from intel_pstate to acpi_cpufreq driver via systemd / kernelstub ?
Any help is appreciated !
LinuxNewbie here!

Update:1
I figured out that command for the same would be : 
  - ` sudo kernelstub -a "intel_pstate=disable" `


But I do not find acpi_cpufreq / acpi_freq : 
**So is it okay to run the above command that disables intel_pstate ?**

```

> cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver

       intel_pstate

> ll /lib/modules/5.17.5-76051705-generic/kernel/drivers/cpufreq

       amd_freq_sensitivity.ko 
       amd_pstate.ko 
       p4-clockmod.ko 
       speedstep-lib.ko 
```




### [Reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/oa5m1t/error_after_updating_grub/)

- Pop!_OS uses systemd-boot as the bootloader, so if you want to make those changes you have to do it not in grub config

  - `sudo kernelstub -a XYZ add boot parameter`
  - `sudo kernelstub -d XYZ delete boot parameter`
  - `sudo kernelstub -p print out all boot paramters`
     > **No grub is needed.**
     Depending on what you changed an sudo update-initramfs -u -k all might be needed.</p>
