                    <p>@Angel-Karasu since description is not very descriptive, does this PR close/fix all of the mentioned issues? As by looking at code that's the impression I'm getting but wanted to confirm. 

As in that case I'd suggest something like `Closes: #YX`. After PR is merged, then I would suggest you update all 3 issues with message like: "PR #716 is merged which should fix the issue, if problem persists, please feel free to re-open it" or something along those lines.

                    <p>I've improved the description
I'll follow your suggestions after the PR merge</p>
