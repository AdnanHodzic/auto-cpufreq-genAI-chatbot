            <p><strong>Issue #832</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This is my observation.
I wrote fans controller for my laptop, so I had that issue and know what to do. 
So when `auto-cpufreq` runs minimum temperature is 44C when laptop is not touched. If I stop the service, it drops down to 35C.
Which means measuring temperature raises temperature. To overcome this we need to use dynamic slices, i.e. below 45C do the measure once a minute.
My solution in my program as example:

                    <p>Would be great if we had more accurate CPU readings and making decisions based on the same, and to somehow integrate with what you built. 

Please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

                    <p>I recall, on my laptop sensors are read over IRQ-9. If I mask it - all and any readers fail. This fact can be used to detect "issue". Not sure if it is common for all systems.
But than, doing IRQ too often heats CPU. IRQs are handled in the kernel space, I guess much of the wrapping code happens.

                    <p>As for "joining", I just made logic of the turbo-boost control, based on [derivatives](https://github.com/alexzk1/MsiFanControl/blob/cea5384db73419a911bb3f7cf4bccb21e14bd8ec/MsiFanControlGUI/booster_onoff_decider.h#L21).
Works awesome, 2 minutes stress CPU test didn't triggered the fan's boost.
