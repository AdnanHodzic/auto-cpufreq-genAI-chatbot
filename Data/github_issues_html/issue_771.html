            <h1>Add EPB (Energy Performance Bias) settings support</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #771</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This PR adds support for the `energy_perf_bias` setting, giving users more control over how their Intel CPU (`intel_pstate` driver) balances performance and power efficiency

What's Changed:
- Introduced a new `energy_perf_bias` option, which can be set as a number (0-15) or using predefined strings like "performance", "balance_performance", "default", "balance_power" and "power" (made their names the same as EPP's)
- Integrated the `energy_perf_bias` setting into the existing power management logic, dynamically adjusting it based on the selected profile or user preferences
- Updated the documentation to explain how to configure and use the new `energy_perf_bias` setting

Closes: #522 

Looking forward to any feedback or suggestions!</p>

                    <p>LGTM & this is great stuff! Making my experience much smoother.

It would be great if it could be enabled by default (automatically) without having to explicitly specify it as part of config file.

Setting i.e `energy_perf_bias = balance_power` when on powersavings governor & `energy_perf_bias = balance_performance` when on performance? 

Either way, thank you for your contribution, you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic Thank you for the amazing project! Regarding the configuration, if the parameter is missing in the configuration file, `balance_performance` (on charge) and `balance_power` (on battery) will be used if the hardware supports it. My mistake, I forgot to specify this in both the PR description and the documentation</p>

Yes I saw that in lines like

```
    if Path("/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate").exists() is False:
        print('Not setting EPB (not supported by system)')
        return
    epb = "balance_performance" if profile == "charger" else "balance_power"
```

But I misinterpreted it that it would be used only as part of config file if you didn't explicitly define other settings.

Could you please create a PR to update ReadMe with this info, just to avoid any confusion? Thanks!</p>
