            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I have heard that there are some [improvements](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/04/ubuntu-24-04-battery-life-improvements) made for better battery health and backup in Ubuntu 24.04.
The question is, Do we still need auto-cpufeq in Ubuntu 24.04?</p>

Absolutely, I've been running on 24.04. 

Not convinced try measuring how much battery life you get with and without auto-cpufreq. 

Closing the issue since it's more of a [question/discussion](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions) then an issue.

I also suggest watching one of the auto-cpufreq videos to understand how it saves battery the way it does, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPGpkZ0AZVU or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg</p>
