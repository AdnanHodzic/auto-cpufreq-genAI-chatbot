                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When running auto-cpufrq --update, in case there's an update available, I need to answer yes manually for the actual update to take place. I'd like to include the update command as part of a System update Bash script, so I need it to be non-interactive.

Could you add an option to answer yes as part of the syntax, similar to the apt command (apt -y install <package_name>).

Thanks</p>
