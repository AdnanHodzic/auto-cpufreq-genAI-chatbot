                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>* A bit of refactoring
* solves #14 As I didn't find how to get temperature for AMD Ryzen, I just display `acpitz` instead of core temp.

                    <p>This is great, thank you for your contribution!

Since it seems you have an AMD CPU and know your way around it. If you have time to look at #17 that would be great. As resolving this would basically add AMD support for `auto-cpufreq` which would be a huge contribution.</p>

                    <p>Yeah, I read about #17. But in my case , I have 2 governors: `performance` and `powersafe`.  
It seems that some AMD CPUs don't have `powersafe` but `schedutil` instead.

BTW: I increased my bat life from 5h to 9h! it's very nice and helpful project, thank you for this!  
Also, it's cool that it's written in python, because I'm a python dev and very love thins language, so glad to contribute :)</p>

Weird, first thing that comes to mind is to make additional check which governors to use based on which AMD CPU is detected.

Great! In that case I hope I'll see more of your pull requests and I'll make sure to add your contributions in release notes of a new release.</p>
