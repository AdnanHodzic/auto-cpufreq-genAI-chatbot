how do I make this change exactly, for this manual workaround?</p>

```sh
sudo rm /etc/os-release
sudo cp /etc/pop-os/os-release /etc/os-release
```

That'll do it, though there might be a better way with a hard link.</p>

Can confirm that a hard link works, but agree that an automatic fix would be preferred.</p>

                    <p>The snap is strictly confined so it shouldn't be able to reach Pop!_OS's `/etc/os-release` file? The whole point of snap is actually that as well. I looked at core.py and the only line it tries to read is [L855](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L855) but I still can't understand whether that's possible or not.

Edit 1: OK, [looks like](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/show-actual-distro-info-instead-of-ubuntu-core-18/15381) this can be done by using system-observe plug.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I believe this issue is resolved. Pop OS is the odd one out. It's not auto-cpufreq's fault.</p>

                    <p>@utk-dev thanks for the heads up, in that case I'm closing the issue.</p>
