            <p><strong>Issue #464</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>After the latest kernel update, my laptop has become incredibly slow.
OS: Arch Linux
Kernel Version: 6.0.11-arch1-1

While auto-cpufreq is running, my cpu frequency on all cores seems to go down as far as 409 Hz.

I did stumble upon [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/zccknj/the_latest_kernel_6011arch11_has_made_my_laptop/) which identified the issue as the new AMD p-state driver. But I didn't see the error reported here, so just passing it along.

As of now, I've had to disable auto-cpufreq to get a usable system.

The person in the reddit post isn't me, but as I understand it, they switched to the 6.0.11 zen kernel and the issue was solved. I believe 6.0.11-arch1-1 uses the new amd p-state driver and that's what is causing the issue. I'm not entirely sure if this is something that needs to be reported to the driver folks or here.

                    <p>Hi, I am the person who posted the issue on Reddit. I had no problem with the Arch Linux 6.0.10 kernel. The issue is present with any type of 6.0.11 kernel (I tested with the mainline and zen kernel). Disabling auto-cpufreq in 6.0.11 fixes the problem. And as OP and one of the commenters pointed out in the reddit post, it's probably happening because of the newly added AMD P-State driver to 6.0.11 kernel. Maybe disabling AMD P-State and using acpi-cpufreq will fix the issue, like it's described in the troubleshooting portion of Readme for Intel CPUs?</p>

                    <p>I was too affected by this misfortune, but disabling `auto-cpufreq` is definitely not an option for me. With it, I'm able to squeeze up to 6 hours from the battery!

Disabling `amd-pstate` did help, but there's no precise info on how to do this in the Readme (only an Intel related issue).

Setting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="initcall_blacklist=amd_pstate_init amd_pstate.enable=0"` in `/etc/default/grub` worked for me, and I am again using the `acpi-cpufreq` driver.

I believe, the Readme Troubleshooting should be updated with this, and if you agree, I can create a PR.</p>

                    <p>I'm curious now... How does battery differ between auto-cpufreq and p-state?</p>

Please go for it, and I'll make sure to note your contribution in [next release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).
 
@abdullahsabbir that seems to be case as confirmde by @biggus-dickus. Let's go with this as a workaround for now, although it seems like a problem on Arch/kernel/driver side instead of auto-cpufreq, as it allows kernel to do the heavy lifting and auto-cpufreq simply pulls the necessary hooks to make system better optimized. Hence I'm bit baffled by what's happening here exactly.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to @biggus-dickus and his changes in #466, in Troubleshooting session it's now explained how to resolve (workaround) this issue.

I'll leave this issue open for the time being for the reference and in case someone comes up with a better solution.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic would a good solution to this be adding a check for `amd-pstate` and giving the option to disable in the install script (auto-cpufreq-installer)?  If so I can push a PR.</p>

@jarebear6expepjozn6rakjq5iczi3irqwphcvb Sounds good to me, please go ahead! </p>
