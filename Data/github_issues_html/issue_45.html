            <h1>Add the feature that makes EPP changeable </h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #45</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>And that feature fixes the conflict with TLP in terms of `energy_performance_preference` value.</p>

                    <p>`energy_performance_preference=performance` causes a lot of heating issues, so I set this value to `balance_performance`.

`0` implies the best performance, pushes the clock to the upper limit, always.
`255` produces the best power efficiency, pulls the clock to the lowest value that processor has been capable, again, always.

```
performance=0
balance_performance=128
balance_power=192
power=255
default=depends on the chip
```</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but should `s.run("cpufreqctl --epp --set=balance_power", shell=True)` and `s.run("cpufreqctl --epp --set=balance_performance", shell=True)`  only be executed when TLP is running?

Or these are useful settings even if TLP isn't running?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>validatedev:</strong></p>
                    <p>The second one. These are the settings that not just the overrides TLP's settings, but enables the new power efficiency-performance balance options.</p>

                    <p>Nice! Okay good to know because I was about to make changes that this is only applied if `auto-cpufreq` detects `tlp start` is running.

Let me test it out, and I'll want to make some minor changes regarding `cpufreqctl.sh` deployment and I'll get back to you.</p>

                    <p>@validatedev I made some and pushed some changes but for some reason this resulted in creating another branch in your forked repo:

Could you merge changes from this new branch to this PR branch? Or just set that branch new target to be merged with my `master`?</p>
