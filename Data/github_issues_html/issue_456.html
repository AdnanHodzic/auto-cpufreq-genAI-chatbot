@mdhishamsayed in that issue [there's a fix ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/441#issuecomment-1312370014) which seems to fix the problem on Arch. Could you please confirm this?</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic Good morning/afternoon/evening/night sir
the fork by @SunkenHero works.
I thank you for helping me, closing the issue

                    <p>Looks like you installed a older version of auto-cpufreq, which got the old percentage code
`return round(psutil.sensors_battery().percent)`
Could you please try installing the newest version and tell us, if it worked.</p>

Nice catch. I'll also re-open this issue, so people are not using that forked version as they'll miss out on new features that are added in auto-cpufreq.</p>

the version 1.9.6 was previously installed, i removed it and installed the fork version which worked

                    <p>@mdhishamsayed  The thing is, was the 1.9.6 you installed from the release page or directly from the newest code

                    <p>In last commit I removed the buggy battery percentage monitor, so there's no need to used forked version anymore (you were missing on latest features with it).

Please pull and install latest changes and verify that everything is working as expected.

@SunkenHero feel free to create a PR to add back battery percentage monitor once you fixed the problem with it.</p>
