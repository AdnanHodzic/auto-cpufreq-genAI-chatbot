                <p>### Fill out information requested in this template, without doing so issue will be ignored & closed!

Auto-cpufreq will not auto start on laptop boot. I have enabled the daemon via systemctl and I have to manually start the daemon every time i boot my laptop which is not optimal.

                    <p>I also have this problem. I am running 1.9.7 on garuda linux (arch based). I think this is happening due to its conflict with power-profiles-daemon.service. I noticed that even after disabling the power-profiles-daemon.service after a reboot the service was up and running and the auto-cpufreq was inactive(dead) despite being enabled.

Well it's not happening. I manually disabled power-profiles-daemon.service with systemctl but it's still up and running and the auto-cpufreq is not.
Since I am using arch based distro I figured I didn't need to use the ```auto-cpufreq --install``` flag and just enabling them from the systemctl should be fine according to this https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/84 .

                    <p>Yes, unfortunately I can't help you further with this, as I don't use Arch and AUR package is not maintained from [what I know and as it's mentioned on Readme](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#aur-package-archmanjaro-linux).

                    <p>I feel kinda stupid for posting this but today I decided to finally find a solution to my problems and the only thing that worked was masking the power-profiles-daemon.service. I believe that KDE powerdevil was calling this service at each startup causing the auto-cpufreq.service despite being enabled to get stopped because of the conflict.
Would be nice if the Readme was updated for arch users to 
~~~
sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon.service
~~~
followed by:
~~~
sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq
~~~
As this is enough for the service to get up and running. Provided it was downloaded from AUR

                    <p>Hello! I have a same problem on the already updated fedora 41. I fully reinstall auto-cpufreq. But after restarting operating system is active gnome power deamon.
I made:
```
sudo systemctl stop power-profiles-daemon.service
sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start auto-cpufreq.service
```
All is fine, it works. Restart, and it don't work again.

Just to be sure you have enabled the service already right?

```
sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq.service
