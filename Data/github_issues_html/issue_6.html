                <p>I cannot be able to see the stream of the log. It just stopped with the following content:

                    <p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but you're saying that `auto-cpufreq --log` stops working? Or that it doesn't displays logs anymore?

What would happen if you ran `sudo python3 auto-cpufreq.py --log` from `auto-cpufreq` git repo?</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Yeah it had stopped, reinstalled and that problem has been solved but don't sure it persist. Watching the situation atm.
Edit: After installing and rebooting the OS, the problem has happened again. And same problem happens with `sudo python3 auto-cpufreq.py --log`.</p>

                    <p>Well, it has started to work again. Interesting.</p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Maybe it has something to do with running an unreleased Ubuntu version. 

But not sure, either way I'll close the issue for now and feel free to re-open it, if the problem resurfaces.</p>

                    <p>This problem still arises with the new PR. 

The process is running but doesn't log anything.

                    <p>@Exorust I merged PR #25 

If this problem is still there with latest changes, could you tell me what's the output of running:

```
tail -f -n 50 /var/log/auto-cpufreq.log 
```

and let's continue the discussion in #31 </p>

                    <p>I pulled the latest master with #25 in it and has been running the tool for a while. So far no issue, everything works well.

Minor likely, even when the laptop is fully charged it says "Battery is: charging ", although it doesn't cause any issue or misbehavior.</p>

Great!

Yes I noticed this as well, but it's not a problem, it's how the library works.

We can change `charging` with `AC` .</p>

                    <p>I think `charging` is okay. Because if you think about it that's exactly what's happening when the cable is plugged in.</p>
