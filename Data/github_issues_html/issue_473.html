            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I installed the latest version of auto-cpufreq from the AUR (binary release 1.9.7-1) on my Garuda Linux (Arch derivative) notebook (HP Elitebook with Ryzen 6800U). But any invocation of the program leads to a python error.


I have the latest version of everything, including Python.

                    <p>Looks like I solved my own problem. For some reason my AUR helper didn't install python-setuptools as a dependency. Once it did, everything started working.</p>
