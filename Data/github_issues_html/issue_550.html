            <h1>Fixes auto-cpufreq --update for Arch based distros for non AUR installations</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #550</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Details:
-  Updated logic now checks if auto-cpufreq is installed via AUR or not (pacman -Q auto-cpufreq). If found, it recommends using the system package manager to refresh it.

-  Removed the obsolete yay checking as yay is considered a Pacman wrapper. (Need confirmation from @cosmos1721 for intent) 

Fixes:
Persistant `Arch-based distribution with AUR support detected. Please refresh auto-cpufreq using your AUR helper.` error, even when you haven't installed auto-cpufreq from AUR, on Arch Distro.

                    <p>Yeah, `yay` should never have been used in the first place as a lot of Arch systems don't even use it, while `pacman` is available on all Arch systems</p>

                    <p>Great one @rootCircle! Because I was proposing the same to @cosmos1721 as part of of the comments in original PR. But idea was that we'd wait for a PR like this one coming from Arch user :) </p>

@cosmos1721 
I could find references of arch checking in `auto-cpufreq/gui/objects.py`, `auto-cpufreq-installer` and `auto-cpufreq/core.py`. But, all their usage were safe in my opinion.

For now, I will wait for next release to test the update on Arch and will report, if it breaks. Rest all looks good to me ig:-)
Although, I have tried triggering an update event(editing setup.py) and was successful in installing also, but i need more surety regarding the same.

                    <p>Updated to v2.0.0, update seems to work fine on Arch based distros!

Congrats for the v2.x.x feat! :tada: </p>
