            <p><strong>Issue #558</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>***Changes***

-  **Version Bump**: Have updated the version of the "auto-cpufreq" package from "2.0" to "2.0.0." This version update aligns with semantic versioning practices and provides a more precise representation of the package's version. Also updater fails from `VERSION=2.0` (error handling for that case is implemented in this PR)

-  **Improved Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling when making network requests to the GitHub API in during package update.</p>
