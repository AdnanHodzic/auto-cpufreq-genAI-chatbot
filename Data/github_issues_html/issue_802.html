                <p>Hello,

could you add an option in auto-cpufreq for balanced power profile or something who will be between powersave profile and performance ? There is only these two choices.

When I use the powersave profile, I've got a good batery life but my system is slow (from boot to desktop). When i use performance profile, it is good but the battery life goes down faster. 

So something in between would be good. Otherwise, your software is very good. 

Thanks.

                    <p>@Tuxman2 the options are performance Powesave because those are CPU governors that exist in the kernel there aren't any others. But some things you can try are setting the other options in the config for better performance on battery.</p>
