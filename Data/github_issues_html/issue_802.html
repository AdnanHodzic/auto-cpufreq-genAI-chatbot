                <p>Hello,

could you add an option in auto-cpufreq for balanced power profile or something who will be between powersave profile and performance ? There is only these two choices.

When I use the powersave profile, I've got a good batery life but my system is slow (from boot to desktop). When i use performance profile, it is good but the battery life goes down faster. 

So something in between would be good. Otherwise, your software is very good. 

Thanks.
