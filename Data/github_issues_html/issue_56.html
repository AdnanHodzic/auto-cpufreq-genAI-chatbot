                <p>Hi there!
I just installed a fresh ubuntu 20.04 copy. 
I'm running your app, and i'm liking it so much...i'm not even going to install TLP. 
So... there's also gamemode in ubuntu. As far as as i know, running gamemode, will change your governor to performance ( and so does your app when plugged to ac). 
ubuntu's game mode will disable the performance governor when you exit the game. In this case, as i'm still plugged to ac, how will your app respond?
these 2 won't play well together right? do i need gamemode anyway?
cheers</p>

Glad to hear that :)

App should respond to stay in `performance` mode, if the conditions are satisfied (plugged in, high system load and etc ...). 

I would suggest you monitor what's happening using `auto-cpufreq --log` in case of auto-cpufreq installation otherwise `auto-cpufreq --live`. Please feel free to report an issue if something unexpected is happening.

They actually should. Basically this app should pick up where `gamemode` drops. As I suggested above it's the best to observe what's happening using the logs.</p>
