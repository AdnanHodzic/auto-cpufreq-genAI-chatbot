            <h1>GUI shows "auto-cpufreq daemon is not running" even when the daemon is active</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #897</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>

**System Info:**
- OS: Debian 13 (Trixie) x86_64
- Installed auto-cpufreq from GitHub (not Snap)
- Daemon is active and running (`systemctl status auto-cpufreq` confirms)
- Terminal command `sudo auto-cpufreq --live` works perfectly
- GUI launched via `./start_app` from the cloned repo

**Problem:**
The graphical interface (`auto-cpufreq-gtk`) always shows the message "auto-cpufreq daemon is not running" and prompts to install it, even though the daemon is already installed and running.

**What I tried:**
- Removed Snap version
- Reinstalled from GitHub
- Verified daemon is active
- Tried launching GUI with and without `sudo`
- No logs found in `~/.cache/auto-cpufreq/`
- No errors in `journalctl -u auto-cpufreq`

**Expected behavior:**
The GUI should detect the running daemon and display live data or status.

Thanks in advance!

Without `--debug` output, I can't tell what exactly is happening.

Why are you doing this? After you install the daemon, you can simply run the auto-cpufreq from the installed apps? Please check this part of [auto-cpufreq v2 release Youtube video showcasing how to install auto-cpufreq using GTK.](https://youtu.be/SPGpkZ0AZVU?t=362)</p>
