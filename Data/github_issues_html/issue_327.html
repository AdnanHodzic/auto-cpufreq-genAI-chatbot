            <p><strong>Issue #327</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When looping through the power supply class, ignore `hidpp_battery`.
A connected wireless mouse will report itself as a type = "battery"
which may trick auto_cpufreq into thinking that the system is running on
batteries.

The issue above was discovered on a ThinkPad P15 running Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
