                <p>Hello,

I  installed the last source code from github on Fedora 41 Workstation.

Installation is ok (from auto-cpufreq-installer) : successfully installed auto-cpufreq-2.4.0+18a3a93

$ sudo auto-cpufreq --install

What output do you get if you run `stat /usr/local/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq`?

If it's all good and you have exec access it should return 755, i.e:

```
stat /usr/local/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq
  File: /usr/local/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq

```

I think changes are not applied yet, can you do the following. Uninstall auto-cpufreq which will also remove the auto-cpufreq daemon, then [re-install auto-cpufreq (using installer) ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#auto-cpufreq-installer)and [re-install auto-cpufreq daemon](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon). I.e:

```
git pull
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove
```

Make sure auto-cpufreq daemon is gone, i.e:
`sudo auto-cpufreq --stats` doesn't return anything and `ps -ef | grep auto-cpufreq` doesn't return any running processes. 

Then re-install auto-cpufreq and its daemon

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
sudo auto-cpufreq --install 
```</p>

I downloaded your last source code and now it works. :+1:

There is only one last thing. The powersave governor is not setting to use.

Here are the results I've got in the gtk interface:

----- CPU frequency scaling -------------------------

Setting to use "powersave" governor
Warning : governor overwritten using '--force' flag.
Not setting EPP (not supported by system)
Setting to use "balance_power" EPB

So, I'm not in the powersave setting but in the balance setting, that's right ?
But in the gtk interface, Current governor is powersave and governor Override is set to Powersave.

Is there a way to solve this issue ?

Thanks a lot.

Regards.

                    <p>Not setting EPP and powersave governor are 2 different things. From little info you provided I see powersave is set, but EEP is not which is fine as your hardware might not have support for it. Refer to [project readme for more info](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq).

In meantime closing the issue, since original problem has been solved.</p>
