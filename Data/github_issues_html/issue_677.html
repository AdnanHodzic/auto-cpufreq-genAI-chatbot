I'm trying to use auto-cpufreq on a Fedora Silverblue 39 setup. I was able to figure out making a spec file to create an RPM: https://copr-dist-git.fedorainfracloud.org/cgit/sweetbeans/cabos/auto-cpufreq.git/tree/auto-cpufreq.spec

And added the compiled package to my COPR repo: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sweetbeans/cabos/package/auto-cpufreq

auto-cpufreq seems to run perfectly for me, but trying to run `auto-cpufreq-gtk` just crashes silently. I can't find logs or anything anywhere. What can I do to diagnose what is causing the crash?</p>

                    <p>Yeah I installed the .rpm in a container and got the same result.
I'm not very familiar with RPM but is there a reason you don't just use the installer script?</p>

I'm using an immutable OS - and I guess going a step farther, it's a spin of Silverblue with everything customized out of the box (https://github.com/jitcos/cabos), so I wasn't able to use the installer script in my build process unfortunately</p>

                    <p>@m0ngr31 auto-cpufreq works fine, it's only auto-cpufreq-gtk that's causing the issue?

Could you give us the output of: `grep auto-cpufreq-gtk /var/log/syslog`? Another option is `strace auto-cpufreq-gtk` but not sure how useful this one will be in this case.

Also, have you seen #601 as it could be relating to the same issue.

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic yeah, regular `auto-cpufreq` works fine, it's just gtk that has the issue. I did see #601, but it I'm able to modify the install enough to get it to install. Just not sure why it's not working.

I can't run the first command since `/var/log/syslog` doesn't exist on Silverblue :facepalm:. I'll have to install `strace` and reboot to see what that one gives me</p>
