                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello,

As part of https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/commit/02bfd551c2f60924e68f3e8bc5efe340ca7ea533 commit I accidentally pushed a `auto-cpufreq_1.2.1_amd64.snap` file. Which adds additional (unneeded) ~19 MB to projects git history, which is evident when project is cloned for the first time.

In meantime I removed it from auto-cpufreq repo and made changes so some thing can't happen again. But, the tricky part is that this commit was pushed to a few other repositories, including:

@rrodriguez81 https://github.com/rrodriguez81/auto-cpufreq
@sebastian-xyz https://github.com/sebastian-xyz/auto-cpufreq
@crispud https://github.com/crispud/auto-cpufreq
@easyriders https://github.com/easyriders/auto-cpufreq as well as `v1.2.2` tag.

You can verify this by running:

```
git log --all --full-history -- "**auto-cpufreq_1.2.1_amd64.snap*"
```

Output should be something like this, and you'll be able to see this binary as part of the commit: 

```
commit 33f3b195c0222c2f85e4b74b9a5f93c32e8f504e
Author: Adnan Hodzic <adnan@hodzic.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 14 11:28:29 2020 +0200

    removed unused power lib
```

Hence, could you please remove this file by running the following inside your forked auto-cpufreq repo.

```
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch auto-cpufreq_1.2.1_amd64.snap" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

git push origin --force --all

git push origin --force --tags
```

You can also refer to [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).

Thanks and please inform me if you have any additional questions and/or comments,
