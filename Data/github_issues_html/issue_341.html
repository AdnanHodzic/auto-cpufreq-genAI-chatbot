            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Currently, as discussed in #340 , for those that installed auto-cpufreq using the `auto-cpufreq-installer`, the update needs to be done manually, by downloading the new release and installing again.

Implemeting a new command, like `auto-cpufreq --update` to automatically do so would be a nice feature.</p>

                    <p>Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself, if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>

Hence closing the issue.</p>
