            <p><strong>Issue #472</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>It looks like auto-cpufreq is incorrectly changing the CPU scaling governor when I have a Sony controller connected over Bluetooth on my Desktop PC. This doesn't happen on my Laptop when charging connected to the wall and it's noticeable as it affects FPS when gaming. 

As an example: having my controller connected over Bluetooth and wired is the difference between 45 FPS and 60 FPS on God Of War HD in RPCS3.

As soon as the controller is connected auto-cpufreq changes my CPU scaling governor from `Performance` to `Powersave` and reports the battery as `discharging`, this happens with both the Dualsense and the Dualshock 4 controllers. If I turn the controllers off or connect them through cable to the PC, either while still over Bluetooth or turned off, then the CPU scaling is then correctly set to `Performance`.

I use Nobara 37, which ships auto-cpufreq by default, and another user have also confirmed this same behavior on the distro's Discord server/channel with their Dualsense and Dualshock 4 controllers. Another person with a Xbox controller couldn't reproduce the issue over Bluetooth.

From the looks of it, auto-cpufreq is incorrectly using the controllers battery status as an indicator to change the scaling governor.

I can also confirm this doesn't happen with power-profiles-daemon, neither does it happen with no power optimizers.

Modifying `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` so it uses `Performance` when on battery works, but it feels like a workaround instead of a solution.

                    <p>Sorry to bother, but is there any update on this? I'd rather be able to use auto-cpufreq since it performs a lot better than power-profiles-daemon on my laptop, but it have been removed from Nobara's repos because of this issue.</p>
