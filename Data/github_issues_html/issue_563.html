I have tried both the normal and -git packages on the AUR. I have also tried using the installer however both lead to the same issue. In output `journalctl -xb` there are a ton of errors with this same comment.</p>

Interestingly the reason I discovered this is I was trying to debug why this tool wasn't able to set the cpu turboboost option anymore even though it seemed to have worked fine in the past? I noticed @Fxzzi has the same line in their output as I do
`Warning: CPU turbo is not available`

I've never seen this error show up until a recently, and it worked in the past, might have been an update?

Both mine and @Fxzzi amd cpu's do support turboboost/core, could it be related to this at all?

                    <p>I've noticed all of us are using the `amd-pstate-epp` driver. Seems like it is linked to that. </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>shadeyg56:</strong></p>
                    <p>so I would recommend you guys switch over to using `acpi-cpufreq` driver as that is most compatible with auto-cpufreq. Information on this can be found in the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting) section of the README.
both `amd-pstate` and `amd-pstate-epp` provide their own sort of scaling and also disables turbo for some reason? not really sure why. 

If you still feel that `amd-pstate` works better then continue to use that, but just know that is why journal is being spammed and seems to be the reason turbo is "disabled".  you can still use `auto-cpufreq` for switching governors. </p>

                    <p>A more in depth look on the `amd-pstate` driver can be found [here](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.html) on the kernel website for those interested</p>

                    <p>I am aware that the recommendation is to switch to the "acpi-cpufreq" driver. However, the "amd-pstate-epp" driver seems to make my desktop slightly more responsive when running on battery with little impact on the battery life.

Wondering if it would be possible to ignore the "line 105: echo: write error: Device or resource busy" error message? I can make a PR which does that, however, I'm unsure if it would have any adverse consequences.</p>

Always feel free to create a PR (especially for something that could be an improvement), and then things can be further tested during its review process. 

Hence, give it a try and if PR is merged and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).
