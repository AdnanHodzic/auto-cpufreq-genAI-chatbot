I firstly installed it following your manual with snap ``sudo snap install auto-cpufreq`` .

Worked like a charm and I used ``systemctl status snap.auto-cpufreq.service.service`` afterwards to see if it was running:

(sudo) systemctl status snap.auto-cpufreq.service.service

I then deleted it with snap and used my loved ``apt`` and your advice on this and this works PERFECTLY.
Just the ``snap`` thing misses something,

Many thanks again and best regards,

Weird, it's good to know it's working with installer/apt. In meantime, I'll leave this bug report open to see if anyone ran into similar issue and will take a more thorough look when I have some time.</p>
