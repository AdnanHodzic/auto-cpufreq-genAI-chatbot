                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hey, I noticed some conditionals that never get hit.

This PR adds no functionality, just cleans up the code a little in case you want it.

Thanks for making the project

                    <p>Hi @Yustynn, 

Thank you for your contribution, but why do you find `cpuload <= 25` part of this particular conditions redundant? </p>

                    <p>Your prior conditional in all the cases was
```python
if cpuload >= 20:
```

So by definition, if it ever gets past that the CPU load is `< 20` and therefore `<=25`
</p>
                </div>

Ah, that's the part that I missed. Good catch, thank you for your contribution! </p>
