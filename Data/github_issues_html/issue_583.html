--- also for some reason, after the update, my cpu temperatures are not displayed, on 1.9.4 were working fine, but on 1.9.8 and on 2.00 are not displayed.

                    <p>So, I was able to "fix" it by switching the governor on battery from "powersave" to "conservative" https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/398#issuecomment-1317507620</p>

                    <p>Hey @mirocw, we had an issue recently with temperatures that got fixed but I haven't seen this where it returns 0

Could you do me a favor and run the following commands and post the output?
```
pip install psutil
python

The thing is, the temperature were displayed fine in 1.9.4 version, and after an update to 1.9.8 (maybe 2-3 month ago) they stopped showing, but also maybe around that time I've upgraded from Linux Mint 21.1, to 21.2. Maybe that's the problem or maybe kernel updates?
I updated to version 2.0 a few days ago.</p>

Alright so `acpitz` should be your cpu temp reported by acpi but for some reason it is reporting it as 0. If i had to guess, I would say this is something to do with the kernel. I run bleeding edge kernel so I am not sure. 

I'm not very familiar with Mint, is there a way you can rollback or update your kernel?</p>

yes, i've tried numerous kernels form 5.15, 5.19, 6.2. All of them don't report temperature. For me personally it's not a big deal, since I have an applet for temperatures that pull cpu temp from "k10temp" sensor</p>

                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

I'd still like to get this fixed. I can make a workaround where if a sensor is reporting 0 it won't use that one and will skip to the next one. In your case, auto-cpufreq would skip from acpitz to k10temp</p>

                    <p>Should be fixed by #586
