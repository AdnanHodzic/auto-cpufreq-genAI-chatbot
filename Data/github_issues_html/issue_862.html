                    <p>Good catch, indeed this was removed but wasn't done as part of README. 

Thank you for your contribution, you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases). </p>

                    <p>May I know why the `--completions` patch was reverted?
Having completions would really ease the use of the cli tool.</p>

It felt like going too deep into configuring users system and outside of auto-cpufreq scope. Besides this is also didn't exactly work as expected.

If this functionality was implemented as part of auto-cpufreq itself, and didn't need to be a separate flag then I would consider having it back.</p>
