Didn't work, still the same output as before 1600 and 1900. Another weird thing that i noticed was that when i gave the stress command to stress 9 cpu threads to 100%, the frequency was always 1600, it never went to 1900.

I see this confirmed here, I also saw another mentioned of this in another bug report, as this is a regression which I [originally mentioned this](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/349#issuecomment-1007712682) to @bobslept as part of his #349 PR. In a nutshell, what was happening before and what was [displayed as part of auto-cpufreq demo on Youtube](https://youtu.be/QkYRpVEEIlg?t=243) is not happening for me anymore. Hence, if my CPU usage in % starts to increase and is above >= 70 or even in 100% range, instead of cores kicking in to their max, they'll never get there anymore.

This is what my CPU stats look like while I'm stressing all of my cores: `stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 4 --timeout 60`

```
CPU max frequency: 4600 MHz
CPU min frequency: 400 MHz

Core	Usage	Temperature	Frequency
CPU0:	100.0%     70 °C     1900 MHz
CPU1:	100.0%     69 °C     1900 MHz
CPU2:	100.0%     70 °C     1900 MHz
CPU3:	100.0%     72 °C     1900 MHz
CPU4:	100.0%     70 °C     1900 MHz
CPU5:	100.0%     69 °C     1900 MHz
CPU6:	100.0%     70 °C     1900 MHz
CPU7:	100.0%     72 °C     1900 MHz
```

I haven't had a time to look into this, but I'm sure one of the conditions as part of [set_performance function](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L742) is messing something up.

In meantime, if anyone has time to look into this and make a [code contribution](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution) that would be great! </p>

On battery with powersave governor it locks on 1400mhz. If change governor to `shedutil` on battery I hit max speeds.</p>

                    <p>@bobslept yea I remember that it worked for you when I initially mentioned this issue. Can you confirm you're also not using the auto-cpufreq config file?

While I'm running on Intel ...

... it doesn't seem to be an Intel only thing as @Hikandy is running on Ryzen 7 and has this problem. Really hard to pinpoint what exactly is causing this behavior ...</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>bobslept:</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm not using the config file normally. 

He says speed is not going higher then 1600mhz. Which is exactly the same behavior I have using the `powersave` governor on battery, instead it's 1400mhz on my Ryzen. 

So to get max speed when I need it on battery, I switch to `schedutil` governor. But I think `performance` governor would also work. `powersave` just locks the speed on cpu min frequency. Even when turbo is enabled. At least on my system.

Why I chose `schedutil` over `performance` I think was that it would clock down to min frequency instead of max frequency when on `performance`.  But most of the time I'm not heavy lifting when on battery, so I prefer `powersave`.

Btw @AdnanHodzic to pinpoint this, did you try set the stuff manually instead of letting `auto-cpufreq` do it? See if you get different results. Then you can really be sure it's something `auto-cpufreq` does wrong or there is something else going on.

Did you look into platform profiles that controls your power level? Added since 5.12. I mean if I set my profile to low-power it has a max of 20 watts to use if I'm correct. Then I never reach my 3.2ghz no matter how hard I try. That's why we made sure it was on balanced before stopping the `power-profiles-daemon`. I reach max speeds on that mode. But the performance mode is adding 10 watts extra vs balanced in my case. It wouldn't suprise me if it has something todo with that. 

`cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices` to see what profiles are available for your system.</p>

Neither am I, as I like auto-cpufreq to automatically figure what it needs to do. Regardless, I just configured auto-cpufreq config file to:

```
[charger]
governor = performance
turbo = always
[battery]
governor = powersave
turbo = auto
```

output during regular workload is better then it is when CPU is put under pressure ...

Finally, I changed both `call(["powerprofilesctl", "set", "balanced"])` to `call(["powerprofilesctl", "set", "performance"])` as part of `gnome_power_stop_live` & `gnome_power_svc_disable` functions. Ran same stress test and frequencies were as they should (still not at absolute maximum, but way better then it is now) be under so much workload:

There we have it, using team work we managed to pinpoint the problem and that's what caps the frequencies on some hardware. Here's my suggestion how we could resolve this so it works as it should for everybody. 

1: Leave power-profiles-daemon to be set to "balanced" before its disabled. 
2: If user sets "performance" to be used as a governor as part of auto-cpufreq config file. New functionality should be added to auto-cpufreq, where it'll read this from config file, and if `performance` is set to call a new parameter as part of `power_helper.py` script (example: `--gnome_power_disable_performance`) which will:
2.1: run `--gnome_power_enable` to enable `power-profiles-daemon`
2.2: run `--gnome_power_disable_performance` which will disable `power-profiles-daemon` with `performance` governor.

Other option is to instruct people to change code and re-install auto-cpufreq (as I did) which is incredibly ugly and not really a solution. Would love to hear your thoughts.

3. I'm baffled why in current setup with `balanced` my frequencies started of good/high (as they should) and then they were lowered in each iteration ...

Btw`cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices` returns `low-power balanced performance`</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I don't use power-profiles-daemon though so I don't think i can resolve it via your suggestions </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic 
Why would you reinstall the application, or modify it? Just let the user specify the platform profile. We stop `power-profiles-daemon` on balanced mode, their 'default' setting.

If that profile does not fit the user they could set the system profile themselfs? If they have support for it.

To get supported profiles from your system:
`cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices`

Set it to performance profile for example:
`echo performance > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile`

I would not set it automatic to performance. Let the user be responsible for it. But that's my opinion.

@Hikandy You are correct this stuff is all unrelated to your issue.</p>

                    <p>My settings are sadly not respected either. Turbo is set to never but it turns on all the time when a charger is plugged in.
In the debug output it says that turbo is on, while it is turned off in the config and running `auto-cpufreq --stats` also says its turned off:
