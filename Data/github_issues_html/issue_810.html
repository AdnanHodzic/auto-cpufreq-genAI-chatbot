            <h1>Enhance System Monitoring with a TUI</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #810</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>## Summary  
This PR introduces a **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** using `urwid` to improve the visualization of system information, monitoring, and live statistics.

## Changes  
- **Added a system info module** to retrieve all necessary system details.  
- **Implemented a system monitor module** to manage the TUI using `urwid`.  
- **Fixed an issue with `set_autofreq()`** where `avg_all_core_temp` was undefined when running in a separate thread.

This looks great, gives a better overview and is just a great improvement overall with updates to the "metrics".

However, when I try to use `sudo auto-cpufreq --stats` command after auto-cpufreq is installed using a snap package I get following error:

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --stats            

Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file

Due to Snap package confinement limitations please consider installing auto-cpufreq using

It would be great to fix this before changes are merged.

Another thing I noticed during testing is that auto-cpufreq GUI is inconsistent with CLI output and is missing i.e "System Statistics" header. Would be ideal if they both had same layout.

i don't know how the GUI built so maybe the GUI author can help with this, but for the TUI i can change the design if you want </p>

Thanks! I just pulled the latest changes, built the snap package and it all seems to work as expected!

@shadeyg56 as the original implementer of GUI, any comments or suggestions regarding this?

> but for the TUI i can change the design if you want

Out of curiosity, what are the design or color options?
</p>

Nice :)

most of the colors are supported check [urwid Display Attributes docs](https://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#display-attributes) and you can apply the color in  `auto_cpufreq/modules/system_monitor.py` line 65 to see how to looks 

for the layout options check [urwid widget layout docs](https://urwid.org/manual/widgets.html#widget-layout)</p>
                </div>

                    <p>I once again reviewed the code and have been testing it for days now. At this point all I can say is LGTM :) 

[Nix build is failing because it's missing `urwid`,](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/actions/runs/13471250096/job/38028152895?pr=810#step:5:646) @shadeyg56 and I've [also put this on Discord ](https://discord.com/channels/1158239366251020361/1158239367337349164/1345270410740240477)so I hope someone using Nix will fix this.

I'm merging the changes, and if anyone else notices or has problem between differences in CLI and GUI interface which I mentioned above:
 > Another thing I noticed during testing is that auto-cpufreq GUI is inconsistent with CLI output and is missing i.e "System Statistics" header. Would be ideal if they both had same layout.
 
 Please feel free to create a PR to "sync" the layout between these two. For reference GTK/GUI was implemented as part of following PR's: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/486 https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/554
