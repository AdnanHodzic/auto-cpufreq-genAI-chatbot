I'm curious how and why did you settle on 100 instead of i.e: 80?</p>

80 is just too low, 100 is a better option I think, could be 160 as well, then we can say it's twice as much of what PEP-8 recommends.
After all we are not forced to use 80x25 terminals like in the '90s. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Makes sense and it looks good. 

Was thinking if we're doing this with code as part of this PR I would also change the output to be 100 instead of 80 characters long, i.e: 

```
------------------------------ Current CPU stats ------------------------------
------------------ Running auto-cpufreq daemon install script ------------------
```

all of these are <= 80 but then most of the space would be empty and it won't look good if terminal is scaled below 100 characters, so let's keep as it is unless you have a better idea.</p>
                </div>

I think we can use a function, that dynamically prints out messages in the above format considering the terminal size.
I've quickly created an example, try it out, it works fine.
You can control the inner padding as well as the decor character(s) to use:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

def dynamic_print(message, decor="-", padding=1):
    """
    Dinamically print messages according to available terminal width
    If message is equals to or longer than the terminal width, print the message as is

    Parameters:
        message (str): The message to print
        decor (str):   Decorator character(s)
        padding (int): Padding size (how many whitespaces between decor and message)

    Returns:
        str: Formatted message
    """
    term_width = os.get_terminal_size().columns
    message_size = len(message)

    if message_size >= term_width:
        print(message)
        return

    # calculate decor size per side
    decor_size = int((term_width - (message_size + (padding * 2))) / 2)
    decor = f"{int(decor_size / len(decor)) * decor}"
    pad = " " * padding

    # print the formatted message
    print(f"{decor}{pad}{message}{pad}{decor}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dynamic_print("Current CPU stats")
    dynamic_print("Running auto-cpufreq daemon install script")
```

I'll check if there's room for improvement for this, update the scripts to use this and I'll submit this as a separate PR.</p>

This is exactly what I was thinking of and what would be ideal solution but didn't express it as an idea :slightly_smiling_face: 

However, code sample from above didn't dynamically scale anything, and `-` were printed out in multiple lines.</p>

What do you mean? I don't get it.

I tried it on my work laptop (gnome + gnome terminal),  when I posted the example here and it worked.
Now I'm on my home laptop (swaywm + alacritty), also works fine.
Already printed out lines can't be scaled, so if you run the command in a larger sized terminal, then resize it to a smaller size, then the already printed out lines will be wrapped of course. But if you re-run the script after you resized your terminal text will be aligned to that size.

Here's a demo of the command (I only removed the second function call `dynamic_print("Running auto-cpufreq daemon install script")`) run with a oneliner which runs the example every second, for more info:

As you can see, printouts change with every update if you modify the terminal size.

Another demo with the example.py untouched:

It also works here, maybe that it prints out two messages (each of them are decorated), that's what caused the confusion for you...
Maybe you thought that the second message's decorator characters are the continuation of the first one... :)

This the perfect summary right here. Since auto-cpufreq output is re-outputted every 5 seconds I think it would be great if output could be scaled like this. If you have time to implement this as part of auto-cpufreq and create a PR I'll gladly review it!</p>

Sure, I'm planning to do that. ðŸ™‚</p>
