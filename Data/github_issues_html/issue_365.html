            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hey,   
Due to some sound issues, I had to disable powersaving mode for my sound card (i.e. set `options snd-hda-intel power_save=0` in `/etc/modprobe.d/sound.conf`)
In battery it appears that the soundcard enters powersaving again. 
In addition my usb-mouse goes to 'sleep' (after 3sec I need to reactivate it by clicking first)

#### Request Information
Is setting to sleep the soundcard and usb-mouse a **bug** or a **feature**?  
Is there an option to prevent it from doing so?

### High CPU
Furthermore, why are 7/8 cores on 1.8GHz if the designed speed is 1.6GHz **and** there is only little cpu-usage and we use `powersave govenor`?

Cheers,

                    <p>Hey, if I was you I would configure your sound card/mouse not to go to sleep when in `powersave`, it should be simple as that, really has nothing to do with auto-cpufreq.

If you're not fully happy how auto-cpufreq does things automatically you can [always configure it more to your own liking](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq).</p>

                    <p>After some digging, I found that my issue was due to the app "laptop-mode-tools". Thus, I apologize for the confusion.
Thanks anyway for the great piece of software and maintenance :)</p>

Thanks for coming back to me with this, auto-cpufreq [automatically notifies user if TLP is detected](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/power_helper.py#L52) which [causes issues when running together with auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#why-do-i-need-auto-cpufreq), hence same type of check should be made for `laptop-mode-tools`

I always encourage people to [make code contributions](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#code-contribution) if they want to give it a try themselves in resolving this issues for good.</p>
