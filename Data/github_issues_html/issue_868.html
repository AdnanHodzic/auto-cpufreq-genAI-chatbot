            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Snap package https://snapcraft.io/auto-cpufreq was last updated at the end of April.

- It does not have `--turbo` override flag which is part of auto-cpufreq documentation.

Any chance you can update Snap package to add this option ?</p>
