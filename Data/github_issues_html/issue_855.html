                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>It used to always read the config file's "battery" section and report that, even if connected to a charger. I used a hacky solution (simply check the state of the battery, i.e., charging or not charging) and read the correct part of the config file based on that.

                    <p>Hi, 

Could you please be more elaborate in what exactly does this PR fix? As I couldn't replicate what changes with `--monitor` with or without config file with what's currently on `master` branch.</p>

The state of EPP and EPB aren't accurate (nor matches with the GUI's data) when the device is connected to AC / being charged. This fixes that. (I apologize for explaining confusingly).</p>
