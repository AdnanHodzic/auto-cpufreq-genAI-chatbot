            <h1>Unnecessary disk io with custom cpufreqctl</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #191</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Upon doing some profiling on my computer to reduce ssd wear, I noticed that this tool continuously writes to `/usr/bin/cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` every refresh cycle. This seems unnecessary, and I'm a little unsure about the negative impacts of this.

Would it be possible to only install the custom script one time, as part of the setup process, and then leave it there? I'm not sure why it's not, could this be a bug?

Many thanks!</p>

                    <p>Is this is the still the case [1.6.4](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.6.4)? 

@marc0der considering your involvement with this one, any thoughts? </p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic the work I did only introduced a parallel version of this executable but did nothing in terms of how it is used or placed on the file system. I can take a look to see if this can be optimised further.</p>

                    <p>@marc0der I know, please don't take this the wrong way :) 

I noticed increase in issues related to `cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` (although I don't see any reason for it). Hence I'm trying to eliminate false positives and attempting to figure out what the real cause is.

@theol0403 please confirm if this is still the problem with 1.6.4</p>
