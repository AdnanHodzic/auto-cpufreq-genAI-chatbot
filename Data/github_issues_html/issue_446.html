            <p><strong>Issue #446</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The installation was successful, but unfortunately a warning appeared, "**Warning: Changing CPU turbo is not supported. Skipping.**" 
[Intel officially stated that this cpu does not support turbo boost](https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/products/sku/81209/intel-core-i34170t-processor-3m-cache-3-20-ghz/specifications.html?countrylabel=Asia%20Pacific), so the logic of your application is correct. Then, the question I am concerned about now is whether the automatic adjustment of the cpu can still be effectively performed in this case?

                    <p>Looks like its all working. Your CPU is scaling up to 3.70GHz, because you are in performance mode. If you set it in the config file right, your CPU should scale down to save battery life, if you run on battery.</p>
