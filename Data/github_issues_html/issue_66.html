                    <p>Great, stuff.

Just so you are aware where I was going with this. For issues, I was planning to implement similar/same feature to "debug" option I created for [displaylink-debian tool.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/displaylink-debian).

This way whoever was about to report an issue could run `auto-cpufreq --debug` and include useful info to the bug report, i.e: sys info, governors, etc ...</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>We can add `inxi` as deps and call `inxi -Fz` on `--debug`
How do u think? </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I think it's a great for now. It (`inxi`) has everything we need, except maybe the available governors. </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>Yeah governors would be nice to show.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>and useful, as I think a lot of source issues could relate to this. Maybe a mix of `inxi` and `auto-cpufreq` output only showing governor info?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>So, we can add `inxi` as a deps, and then implement `--debug` option to format output with governors</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>Sounds good to me.</p>
