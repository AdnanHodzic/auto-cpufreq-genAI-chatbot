            <h1>Logitech wireless mouse forces battery behavior </h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #328</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Plugging in a Logitech Unifying Receiver and wireless mouse results in auto-cpufreq believing that the system is "discharging", even if it is plugged into AC. 

When the receiver is plugged in, /sys/class/power_supply contains three entries: AC, BAT0, and hidpp_battery_1. The first two correspond to the laptop's AC supply and built in battery; the last one corresponds to the battery in the wireless mouse and is normally always in a discharging state. Unfortunately, the charging() function in core.py is picking up this status and using it to assume that the entire system is on battery power, adjusting the CPU governor accordingly.

The proper behavior should be to check the AC status before all others and/or skip any power_supply entries which are not actual power supplies for the host.
