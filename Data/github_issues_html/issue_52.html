                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I installed the last version of your code with manually installation. After installation without errors, I tried monitor and live and perfectly works. I decide to install it with the proper command and all works. The problem born when I try to execute the log command to see the configuration, but nothing showed. I see that service is running but I can't see the current configuration. Can you help me?</p>

                    <p>How did you perform the install and which distribution are you using? 

If you're using Ubuntu 20.04 I would advise you to perform the [install using snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store).</p>

I'm using Elementary OS 5.1.2 based on Ubuntu 18.04 and I compiled auto-cpufreq using the GitHub guide.</p>

                    <p>Many new changes have been implemented as part of 1.2 release and I believe your problem is solved. 

Install latest version using snap package:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq
```

or pull the latest changes and run:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer
```

In case this doesn't solve your problem, please feel free to re-open this issue.</p>
