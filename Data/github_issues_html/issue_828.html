                <p># Battery Charging Thresholds Not Applied by auto-cpufreq

## Have you tried?
- âœ… Searched through existing/closed issues.
- âœ… Verified installation via `auto-cpufreq --install` and `auto-cpufreq --remove`.
- âœ… Checked GNOME Power Profiles Daemon status.
- âœ… Reviewed `auto-cpufreq --debug` output.

## Error output:
No explicit error message, but **battery charging thresholds** do not seem to be enforced.

## System Information:
```
Linux distro: Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish  
Kernel: 6.8.0-57-generic  
CPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz  
Architecture: x86_64  
Driver: acpi-cpufreq
auto-cpufreq version: 2.5.0  
```

## Issue Description:
Despite setting charging thresholds in `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf`:
```
enable_thresholds = true
start_threshold = 60
stop_threshold = 80
```
Auto-cpufreq does not enforce these limits. The battery is charging beyond the stop threshold with **no rules detected** in `auto-cpufreq --stats`. 

## Steps Taken:
- Installed and removed auto-cpufreq to reset settings.
- Verified GNOME Power Profiles Daemon interference.
- Ensured `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` is properly configured.
- Observed battery stats showing **no charging thresholds applied**.

## Expected Behavior:
Battery charging should **stop at 80%** and **resume at 60%**, but this is not happening.

Would appreciate any guidance on troubleshooting or confirming whether this is a known bug.

                    <p>Hey @rakshitx1 what is your laptop? Vendor and model. Depending on your vendor it may or may not support battery charge thresholds</p>

My laptop is the MSI GF63 11UC (i7-11800H).

I checked `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/`, and I see the following charge control files:  

```bash
charge_control_end_threshold
charge_control_start_threshold
```

Let me know if you need any other details!  </p>
