                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Issue
Installation fails on Pop!_OS 22.04 and similar Ubuntu systems because PyGObject tries to compile against girepository-2.0, which isn't available #833 . These systems only have libgirepository1.0-dev and already include a working python3-gi package.

Changes
- Create venv with --system-site-packages flag to access system Python packages
- Install python3-gi system package in apt dependencies

Tested on Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS. </p>
