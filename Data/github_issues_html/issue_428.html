            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>actually endeavouros. following the instructions to install from the aur and then starting and enabling the systemd service for the daemon instead of the --install command. upon reboot, it says it is enabled but it is inactive (dead) with no failure codes. which makes me think it's not being triggered but the multiusertarget is active. it starts with systemctl start command but it does not stay started with a reboot. </p>

                    <p>I ran monitor and it says gnome power profiles is detected even though I'm on kde. going to investigate if that's the issue. </p>

                    <p>I left the gnome power profiles because other packages were dependent on it </p>
