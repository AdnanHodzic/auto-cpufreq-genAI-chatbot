                <p>Fix for issue #321 

HID device with battery show up under `/sys/class/power_supply`

`hidpp_battery_0`
`hidpp_battery_1`

skip devices contain "hid", tested by user and fixes the issue.

I'm not sure if "hid" is too broad match. that's why I will add those names to the list if future errors come up with this, I can refine if needed.</p>
