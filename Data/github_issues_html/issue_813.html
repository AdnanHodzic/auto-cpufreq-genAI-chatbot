I checked and I do have gir1.2-girepository-2.0-dev package installed already.
Looks like after I manually installed libgirepository-2.0-dev package I got auto-cpufreq-installer ran smooth without error.

                    <p>Fixed with f2c4a2d

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. The newest release of PyGObject switches from libgirepository 1.0 to 2.0, which is unfortunately not available in older versions of Ubuntu. In the interest of a quick, temporary fix, I have pinned PyGObject to a version that uses libgirepository 1.0

@AdnanHodzic this means we have to consider dropping support for older versions of Ubuntu/Debian since libgirepository 2.0 will not be available unless those users install the package from source which is definitely not ideal. Of course, we could keep PyGObject pinned to the working version but it also isn't really a good idea to keep a dependency pinned for the foreseeable future. There isn't really a way to supply different versions of PyGObject based on the user's distro, it is only possible to set different versions for "Linux" as a whole versus "macos" or "win32"</p>

I'm all for dropping it, only problem is that libgirepository 2 is only available as of recently in [Debian >= testing (trixie)](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libgirepository&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) & [Ubuntu >= 24.04](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libgirepository&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) repos so it's not widely available yet. 

> Of course, we could keep PyGObject pinned to the working version but it also isn't really a good idea to keep a dependency pinned for the foreseeable future. 

Let's keep an eye on it, and I'll add this to the releases to make it easier for us to track.</p>
