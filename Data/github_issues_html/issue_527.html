### Have I tried?

- yes, i have tried Searching through existing/closed issues. Found two similar ones. [first one](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/185),  [second one](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/233) but they didn't lead to a solution.
- installation didn't fail.
- I tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq), but it all converges on the same problem. (FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors')
- I tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting). None of them had anything to do with my problem.

I have tried to describe the situation in as much detail as possible. There is however not much to to say,Because I have LITERALLY tried everything. Almost everything requires me to run 'sudo auto-cpufreq --install' But I can't do it because of reasons I've already said. And anything that doesn't need that has nothing to do with my problem.

well, I expected for it just to install and be fine (I don't think I have to say this). I tried configuring it, installing through snap and git. Every other configuring step requires me to run 'sudo auto-cpufreq --install', which as I said, i can't do.

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm curious because [I made some changes made how driver is handled in 1.9.8](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/commit/3dcf2fd837584b5e4481b5a9f23438d65a507502), could you please try installing 1.9.7 and verify if you have the same issue?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Rafalsitar:</strong></p>
                    <p>I have tried 1.9.7.
Having the same error, the error output is the same.
**Is my processor just too old?**
**Also, if my processor is THIS old maybe an even older version would work, have you made some changes how the driver is handled BEFORE 1.9.8?**</p>
                </div>

                    <p>The Celeron 530 does not support speedstep nor turbo boost. This is just lack of hardware support.

Auto-cpufreq could perhaps give a bit more guiding error message when trying to run it on unsupported hardware.</p>

                    <p>@Rafalsitar could you paste the output from `lscpu` and or `cat /proc/cpuinfo`? I suspect this could be detected globally through the lack of some fields there.</p>
