Attempting to run the gtk app when installed from the AUR does not work, as CSS files (and maybe more) are not installed correctly. This is most likely an issue with the PKGBUILD and not really the tool itself. I'm guessing the PKGBUILD was not updated for the additional files it needs to install after 2.0.0

                    <p>Yeah it looks like the maintainer didn't include an install command for the CSS file. I'm not sure how active the maintenance is for the AUR package, but I would leave a comment on there instead. </p>
