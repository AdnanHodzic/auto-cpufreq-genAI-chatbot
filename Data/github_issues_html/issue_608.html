                    <p>virtual environments make managing the dependencies easier and prevents conflicts. for example, if somebody has another program that requires a different version of a package we use, there would be a conflict. </p>

                    <p>ok that makes sense. I was just packaging the program for arch and there isn't a great way to rely on a virtual environment. I'll make sure that version requirements match the aur build system. </p>
