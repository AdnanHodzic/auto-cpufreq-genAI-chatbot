                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I found that when my laptop is idle, about 3-4% of the CPU usage is the process `irq/9-acpi` which appears only when auto-cpufreq is active. I confirmed that suspending and restarting the systemd daemon.
 
A quick investigation with an LLM suggested to try configuring auto-cpufreq to use a shorter polling time, but as far I can tell, I couldn't find any ways to do it.

I would like to first confirm that it is indeed a known auto-cpufreq issue, and if so, how to address it.

Below the output of the debug info on my system from auto-cpufreq..
