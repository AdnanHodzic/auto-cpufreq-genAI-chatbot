                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>It would be nice if KDE would not display on the battery widget under "Power Profiles" that the system need to install power-profile-demon. 

It would be much better if it prints something like "auto-cpufreq being used" like it does when using TLP.

Great thx for writing this software. I get the best battery life and best performance when using this compared to tuned, ppd, TLP, etc.</p>

                    <p>+1 on this suggestion. I am on Fedora 41 KDE and this is how it currently looks like with auto-cpufreq.

Thanks for the amazing piece of software.
