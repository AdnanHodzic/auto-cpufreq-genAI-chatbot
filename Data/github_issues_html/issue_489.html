                    <p>The same thing is happening for me on fedora. The turbo override also isn't working.

The only thing from my config that is overriding default is the governor.

                    <p>Doing what you suggested does apply the boosting config and governor, but the maximum scaling frequency still isn't applied after uninstalling and re-installing auto-cpufreq and a system restart.</p>

                    <p>I also have the same issue. It's not respecting my config file. By default mine cpu min is 1.2ghz (1200000 khz) and max is 3.3ghz (3300000 khz). When I tried to edit min to 1.6ghz, it does not follow instructions, instead min and max are at same level (3.3ghz)

Also for what ever reason when I'm on battery and do the stress cpu test, my cpu is staying at min cpu 1.2ghz

Sorry for the late reply, I have tried restarting my laptop, deleting the config file and recreating it, modifying the config file, using only powersave or performance mode, and updating to a newer version (at this time it is 2.0) but it still didn't help.</p>

                    <p>Try removing and reinstalling the daemon, after making changes to the config file, with:
`sudo auto-cpufreq --remove && sudo auto-cpufreq --install`</p>

Can confirm this works in my case.
Restart the service after apply changes to the config file, e.g.:
`sudo systemctl restart auto-cpufreq`</p>

                    <p>Can you please make sure you have the latest changes pull from `master` branch? After merge of #663 changes made to config file should be automatically picked up without having to do anything ...</p>

                    <p>I am no longer using Linux for my work, so I'm not sure if this issue has been fixed (but I believe it has been fixed based on the latest updates). I will close this issue so that the maintainer can focus on other issues</p>
