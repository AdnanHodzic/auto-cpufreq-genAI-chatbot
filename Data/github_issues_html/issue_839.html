                <p>[bluetooth_boot_off](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#bluetooth_boot_off)
```
    Turn off Bluetooth on boot (only)! Can be turned on any time later on.
```
[bluetooth_boot_on](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#bluetooth_boot_on)
```
    Turn on Bluetooth on boot.
```


Instead of having these as command line arguments, It would be nice if it could be enabled and disabled via the config file.
```
   bluetooth_boot=on/off
```

I am on NixOS using flakes, and I don't really know how I would do that in a declarative way.

                    <p>@scientiac since I'm limited with available time to do this myself and [project is looking for contributors](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#looking-for-developers-and-co-maintainers) if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>

                    <p>Can't this just be done with an init system? e.g. systemd and a Bluetooth focused application?</p>
