                    <p>Let's continue discussion from #59 here.

All you need to do to build a snap with current structure is: 

```
snapcraft
```

After build is successful, all you need to do is install the snap, i.e:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq_1.2_amd64.snap --dangerous
```
and then enable necessary interfaces, i.e:

```
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:cpu-control
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:hardware-observe
sudo snap connect auto-cpufreq:system-observe
```

A lot of people on on forum.snapcraft.com are Canonical employees and are more then willing to help as you [can see from an example](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snap-not-buildable-anymore/19274).

For everything else [I suggest you refer to their official documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-a-snap) or a ask me a question here :)</p>

They were missing as build dependencies. I could've also used deb packages, i.e `python3-psutils` but it's much older version then when downloaded using `pip3` which is what's used in this case.

What you did in this PR is good, but worst case it won't display distro info. Regardless, I pushed it to `edge` channel so feel free to test it by running:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --edge
```

If this makes it work for you, let me know so I can merge it with master.</p>

                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, it works.
But after merging, merge please this #76 </p>
