                <p>> Thank you for the PR, since these changes seem strictly AMD oriented, I've asked [on auto-cpufreq discord channel](https://discord.gg/Sjauxtj6kH) if someone could test these changes.

                    <p>I have the same issue on my Surface Pro 7 on Arch. It tries to write `balance_performance` to `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu7/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference` in my case and fails.

I modified line 105 to point stderr to /dev/null. Not a solution though but a workaround to not spam my logs.
```bash
function write_value () {

    echo $VALUE > $FLNM 2> /dev/null

                    <p>It's probably a silly thought, sorry if I missed the point.

In search for the "bash script echo write error device or resource busy" to have an idea of what could be, it gave me a bunch of GPIO results, some USB related ones and others, but the answer for this one that made sense to me
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/704080/cant-write-to-sys-devices-system-cpu-cpufreq-energy-performance-preference-w

Would it just that options are limited by mode you choose a **scaling_governor** x **energy_performance_preference** relationship? 
If it sets the **scaling_governor** to _performance_, _energy_performance_preference_ only accepts performance as an option in the other hand,  if it sets the **scaling_governor** to _powersave_, **energy_performance_preference** will accept _default balance_performance balance_power power_ as possible options, including _performance_. Just not sure if setting performance for powersave works, but it accepts the change.

So it will always have to check which scaling_governor is being used before trying to write, or limit the list to that relationship. Testing on my machine, with an Intel CPU, that "relationship" holds up, meaning, if I set the scaling governor  to _performance_ i can't change the energy preference from performance without changing the scaling governor back to _powersave_

This would just cure symptoms, not the underlaying issue. So thats why I didn't create a PR.</p>

                    <p>If you tries to use the acpi governor the issue will be gone. it only affects pstate. however acpi may not be an option for you as it seems to break nvidia-powerd so no more GPU boosting.

So I'm back using intel-pstate and I've disabled auto-cpufreq as not being able to use dynamic boost is not a suitable solution for me.</p>

                    <p><strong>LDprg:</strong></p>
                    <p>This seems not to be a intel pstate specific problem! AMD pstate with active mode does result in the same problem.

Probaply both pstate driver manage turbo boost them self (no need for auto-cpufreq to interfere) and the error is just because the turbo boost flag doesn't exist. So turbo boost (or dynamic boost) still works, it is just managed completely within the driver.</p>

In line `105` in `$(which cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq)`</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>So, did some testing and I can confirm that when the `scaling_governor` is set to `performance` in my system with a Intel CPU and `intel_pstate` driver, I cannot set the `energy_performance_preference` to anything but `performance`, as already pointed out by the [comment above](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/661#issuecomment-1987249265). 

Looking into the code in `core.py` in [this](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/8bb7478e38f3c9ef66b5993721f489c6099d8f68/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L945) line, the problematic `cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` is called with the argument  `--epp --set=balance_performance`, this tries to set the `energy_performance_preference` to `balance_performance` but the `intel_pstate` drive does not allow this when the `scaling_governor` is set to `performance` and so we get the spam write error message.

This is resolved when the command is changed to `cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq --epp --set=performance` but this would change the behavior in all the system and not just the affected ones. I don't know the advantages and disadvantages of setting `energy_performance_preference` to `balance_performance` vs `performance` so I don't know if this is a good solution. 

~~Briefly looking through the [kernel documentation for intel_pstate](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html#energy-vs-performance-hints), their is nothing saying why when setting the `scaling_governor` to `performance` the `energy_performance_preference` cannot be set to `balance_performance` or anything but `performance` but this seems to be happening to most systems, so, this might be an intended behavior.~~ 

This seems to be an intended behavior, since according to the [kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html#hwp-performance) when HWP is enabled[(which is enabled by default during boot with supported processors)](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pm/intel_pstate.html#active-mode-with-hwp)and scaling governor is set to `performance` the processor‚Äôs internal P-state selection logic is expected to focus entirely on performance. And this will override the EPP setting and reject any value different from 0 (‚Äúperformance‚Äù).</p>
