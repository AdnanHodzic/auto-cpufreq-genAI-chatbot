            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>### Have you tried?

- [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 
Yes. I have found #426 but they didnt switch to acpi-cpufreq and #202 but that one was closed due to inactivity.
- If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)?
No
- Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?
No cuz its snap only
- Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?
Its covered there as the bullet point 'CPU not scaling to minimum/maximum frequencies' but there is no answer to this problem except for 'use acpi-cpufreq' which I am doing.

Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

I have set  scaling_min_freq = 800000 in /etc/auto-coufreq.conf but its ignoring it. (I have also tried it with  scaling_min_freq = 400000 but I have had the same outcome). When I used amd-pstate it went down to 400Mhz so I know that my cpu is able to go that low.

I installed auto-cpufreq via the aur.

                    <p>`acpi-cpufreq` doesn't expose as many processor states as `amd-pstate`. 
To see the available frequencies, run `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies`</p>
