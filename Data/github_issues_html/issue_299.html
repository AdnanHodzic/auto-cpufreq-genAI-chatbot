            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi, 
I noticed when battery protection is active (the battery charges until 60% ) and the laptop is plugged in but not charging the service detects the battery as unplugged and disables the charging governor.
It would be great if there could be a workaround to use the charging governor and the battery protection at the same time</p>

                    <p>Hi,

Yes it would be great, however I don't own one such device so I'm not sure how I would test this. If you're willing to give it a try, please consider [contributing by creating a PR](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution).</p>

                    <p>This is probably different per Lenovo device. I'm on a Lenovo laptop which uses the ideapad_laptop kernel module. In conservation mode, it stops charging around 60% but still has the charging status.

What is the model you are using?</p>

                    <p>I'm using the same module.
I should add that right now the behavior came back to being normal even if I hadn't changed any configuration.
Maybe it has been some package conflicting with the service but right now I'm not being able to replicate it.</p>

                    <p>For me,
`tlp-stat -b` shows `BAT0` status to be `Idle` but `cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status` shows `Unknown`

This commit should have fixed the issue when battery status is not identified.

EDIT: Works for me on version 1.8.0</p>

                    <p>Thanks for the info, very helpfull.

I'm looking at the code and I'm thinking of rewriting stuff. Little bit scared because I read alot of issues which seems to have a lot of edge cases.

My idea would be fairly simple. 
first check if ac is found, if so check online is 0 or 1 to identify powercable. if not found find battery and check  /status for "Discharge" to be on battery otherwise it is on powercable. 

When there is totally nothing in  /sys/class/power_supply/* then set state to powercord because we are probably on a desktop.

@AdnanHodzic what are your thoughts about this.

I think if I apply my logic on the comment above information, i think that should work. 

@tnagorra could maybe give me the output of the following:
`cat /sys/class/power_supply/A*/type`
`cat /sys/class/power_supply/B*/type`
Which I think should return: Mains and Battery. I hope I'm correct.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>bobslept:</strong></p>
                    <p>I have made some big changes in the battery charging checking code.

Please test this and let me know if it works for you while being on a charger and when you are on battery only.
It's on the `fix-charging-state` branch of my repo. Which you can checkout as described below.

Make sure you remove the current auto-cpufreq installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/bobslept/auto-cpufreq.git
cd auto-cpufreq
git checkout fix-charging-state
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install
```
Now auto-cpufreq is installed. You can now use it in live mode to test the fix like this:
`sudo auto-cpufreq --live`

to remove all this from your system use the remove function from the installer:
`sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove`</p>

> cat /sys/class/power_supply/A*/type
> cat /sys/class/power_supply/B*/type

You are correct. They are `Mains` and `Battery`.

```
[I] ➜ cat /sys/class/power_supply/A*/type
Mains
~
[I] ➜ cat /sys/class/power_supply/B*/type
Battery
```

@bobslept your new changes does work on my PC (thinkpad p14s)

                    <p>Thank you so much for testing this! This really helps alot.
We probably need a little bit more people to test this change before we actually merge it into master.
Thanks again!

                    <p>Thanks to @bobslept the proposed changes have now been merged with `master` branch. Changes will be part of the upcoming 1.8.2 release.  

Until the release is made, changes can be installed by either having latest `master` changes and installing them using [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto-cpufreq-installer) or using `beta` channel of Snap package (`sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta`). With that said I'm closing this issue, please re-open it if the issue persists.</p>
