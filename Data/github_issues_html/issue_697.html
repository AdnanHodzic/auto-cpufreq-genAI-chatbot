Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

My issue is that the computer shuts down even if the battery percentage is high. I'll explain, there are some cases in which this happens. The first case is when I have my computer on balanced mode and I just boot it, it can have like a 40%-60% of battery or less and after finishing the boot, it gives me a notification of "battery level critical, plug-in before the computer is turned off" and if I don't plug it after some 30 sec. it turns off. I think this might happen because the "auto-cpufreq" sees that the booting is taking a lot of CPU and estimates that if it continues to use this much CPU it will turn off in a short amount of time and it turns off the computer. 
On the other hand, we have the other issue which I don't know if it's related or not, which is when the pc gives me the message to "plug-in" the charge and I don't do it, it truns off, instead of going into suspend mode.
I know that this might be a auto-cpufreq problem because it started when I installed it.

Is it related to auto-cpu-freq? is there a way in which I could solve it?

                    <p>Try disabling the auto-cpufreq service then try removing it and see it the problem is still there. When your pc says you battery is to low it's probably the bios giving that error. Check your bios settings.</p>
