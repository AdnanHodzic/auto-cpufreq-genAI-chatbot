                    <p>Yes agreed, there are some attempts to detect version with `sudo auto-cpufreq --debug`, but it's not fully unified as some people install it using `auto-cpufreq-installer `and others using snap or AUR package. But I was planning to do this regardless. 

Regarding update availability, you can simply click on ["Watch" notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories) and can be notified about all changes or only "Release" changes. I think that's most useful for everyone who did install from git, while Snap packages are automatically updated and AUR is also based on automatic build based on new releases.

                    <p>Did a previous install with snap version but i was wondering if it kept it to up to date so i needed to check the installed version ... no success.

I was already following your release ^^</p>

You can check this by running:

```
snap list | grep auto-cpufreq
```</p>
