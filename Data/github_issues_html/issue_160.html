            <h1>Improve domain language around logging and stats</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #160</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This PR attempts to improve the logging/stats domain names as per #156:

* renames all stdout occurrences of `log` to `stats`
* update all code references accordingly
* rename `.log` file to `.stats`
* move the stats file from `/var/log` to `/var/run`
</p>

                    <p>Code changes LGTM. 

As I proposed in #156, only change I'd propose/request is to  leave `--log` hidden flag there for awhile, if whoever runs `sudo auto-cpufreq --log` that they should get a message "Logs option is no longer in use, please use `sudo auto-cpufreq --stats` instead." or something along those lines.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic that's done and tested :+1: </p>

                    <p>@marc0der great stuff! I think it would be a nice idea to add a "time stamp" at the end of each cycle in `--stats` for better reference when scrolling through these, but for now it's perfect as it is.

Thank you for you contribution and I look forward to any new ideas and/or suggestions you may have in future :)
