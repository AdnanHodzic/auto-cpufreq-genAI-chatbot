If you run installer you can follow on screen instructions to install/remove auto-cpufreq: `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer`. [auto-cpufreq config file is not there by default](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq), you need to add and then you'll have have something to edit.</p>
