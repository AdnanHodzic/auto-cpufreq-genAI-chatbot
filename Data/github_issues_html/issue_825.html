                    <p>I found a fix, it seems that  the error from ```pip install PyGObject``` which is required to for the file ```auto_cpufreq_gtk.py``` require ```libgirepository-2.0``` which is available by running ```＄ sudo apt-get install libgirepository-2.0-dev```, I installedit and now its running perfectly, I have to install PyGObject in venv created by auto-cpufreq though. And now GUI is working:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4163744a-4ba6-4b15-974a-8731405c9214). anyone stumbling on the issue should be able to fix it themselves

Hence, I propose PR #826 </p>

                    <p>Problem with older dependencies was also mentioned in #813 </p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>kirmola:</strong></p>
                    <p>all right then, its known then, I'll close this</p>

                    <p>> all right then, its known then, I'll close this

No worries, once #826 is merged, I'll mark that it closes all these 3 issues :) </p>

                    <p>With #826 being merged with `master` branch, your problem should be solved. Please re-run auto-cpufreq-installer and auto-cpufreq daemon with latest code changes.
