                <p>There is no error per say but I wanted to have clarification on what the frequency in the config file represents.

I'm using an i7-11800H. For this chip, the base clock can go up to 2.3GHz, but after the multiplier is applied, the net clock can go much higher (around 4.8GHz). So should I set `scaling_max_freq` to `2300000` or should I set it to `4800000`?</p>

                    <p>If your base of[ 2.3Ghz is same as mine of 1.8Ghz,](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e33ce653f12f4933bdd769ddae47708cd77bd6685dbaf3a3676b2e62f743f857/687474703a2f2f666f6f6c636f6e74726f6c2e6f72672f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032332f30392f6175746f2d637075667265712d76322d6775692e706e67) and max is 4.8Ghz as it is 4.6Ghz for me, then yes `scaling_max_freq` should probably be set to `4800000`. 

Closing this issue, since it's not an issue and should instead be asked as part of [Discussion section.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions)</p>
