                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello, 

after installing auto-cpufreq and its daemon, I am encountering issues with it being killed after working correctly for about 20 minutes. Even after starting the service manually it gets terminated in a few minute by the OS. Is there any idea why this would happen? Is there more information from my side to by provided? The only thing in my mind that I also have `power-profiles-daemon` installed but keeping that on balanced the whole time.

                    <p>That's kinda strange. We thought we fixed this issue. Did you use the latest git version, which in this case should be v1.8.0?

I've just reinstalled fresh clone from master on Fedora 35, and it disabled and masked the power-profiles-daemon on installation so that it would not be in conflict with auto-cpufreq. 

I've also tried with the v1.8.0 release tar.gz without any problems.

When installing as a daemon you should see this warning message:
```
----------------------------------- Warning -----------------------------------

Detected running GNOME Power Profiles daemon service!
This daemon might interfere with auto-cpufreq and has been disabled.

Disabled daemon is not automatically disabled in "live" and "monitor" mode and
will be enabled after auto-cpufreq is removed.
```
Running `systemctl status power-profiles-daemon` after installation should return something like this:
```
○ power-profiles-daemon.service
     Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit power-profiles-daemon.service is masked.)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

                    <p>The warning message did not appear for me during the first install. However, after reainstalling it has appeared and also the `power-profiles-daemon` service is now masked. Everything now seems to be working correctly, thank you for your help, I will report again if other problems arise.</p>
