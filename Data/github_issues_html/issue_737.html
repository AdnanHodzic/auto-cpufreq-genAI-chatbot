Also please be descriptive about the issue you're reporting, i.e: what you tried & what's the expected behaviour.

The output of `auto-cpufreq --debug` reports that the max CPU frequency is 3400Mhz, but the output of `auto-cpufreq --stats` says  that it's 1600Mhz( The max frequency without turbo boost). If  `scaling_max_freq` or `scaling_min_freq` value in the config file is greater than the CPU max frequency of   `auto-cpufreq --stats` , the config file is ignored, and the GUI App only shows "Battery is: Charging".

### Expected Behaviour
It should use the real CPU Max frequency(3400Mhz) as the limit and not the max without turbo

### Proof

### Additional Information

### Output of `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq`: `1600000`
### Output of `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq`: `3400000`

I'm using msr-tools to edit the CPU registers to enable turbo boost, since the option is not present in my Bios. Without it the turbo would be permanently disabled, and if I use the `acpi-cpufreq` driver the turbo works, but it doesn't expose the real max frequency of the CPU, and therefore I can't limit it.
Also I'm using a notebook, but I removed the battery since it died

Instead of getting the CPU Max Frequency from `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq`, it gets from `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq`. As mentioned above, `scaling_max_freq` gets the actual max frequency. By doing so it works correctly:

                    <p>> If scaling_max_freq or scaling_min_freq value in the config file is greater than the CPU max frequency of auto-cpufreq --stats , the config file is ignored, and the GUI App only shows "Battery is: Charging".

This is unfortunately true, and something I was aware of. As like you I would prefer to have I'd like to have `scaling_min_freq = 1800000` (1800Mhz), but instead I'll might see a message like i.e with `--stats`:

>Given value for 'scaling_min_freq' is not within the allowed frequencies 400000-4600000 kHz

So I'd have to set it to `400000` instead, but I also found a way I can make this message dissapear even with `1800000` if I restart auto-cpufreq daemon after making changes to auto-cpufreq.conf

```
systemctl stop auto-cpufreq 
systemctl start auto-cpufreq 
```

But even then I might see them go to 800Mhz instead when 1800 should be the `scaling_min_freq`. If I leave `turbo = auto` instead of `turbo = always` where indeed then it never goes under 1800.

I never had the problem you had, as my max frequencies were always reached. I will even get same values for both:

> Output of cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq: 1600000
> Output of cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq: 3400000

Where in my case these values are the same:

```
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq
4600000
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
4600000
```

But I also see you're limiting the `scaling_max_freq`, why are you doing this?

> scaling_max_freq = 2600000

> I've made a [fork](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/compare/master...LDrawe:auto-cpufreq:master) and edited cpufreqctl.sh

I would encourage you to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases), as if it fixes an issue it's def worth having.

But can you share are you values before and after the changes? Because for me they are all the same between max & min:

```
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq
400000
400000

400000
400000
400000
400000
400000
400000
```

And finally just wanted to add that both my min & max frequency are correctly identified in both `--stats` and `--debug`, i.e:

Interesting. Maybe when the CPU enter turbo state it's exposing these frequencies to the system? That would explain why setting to "always" it would never go down 1800, as this frequency is always available. I will try this and report back.

>But I also see you're limiting the scaling_max_freq, why are you doing this?

Mainly because of temps and fan noise. When gaming it would almost always reach 3.4GHz and increase the temperature to the thermal limit of 100°, to then throttle down to 400mhz because of these high temps, even tough I'm not playing heavy or CPU intensive games. . Even on desktop it reaches 85° on normal use, along with the noisy fans. I found that between 2.1 - 2.7Ghz is the sweet spot, where I can get stable FPS, frametime and good temps.

That would be super cool! I can make a PR with these changes I've made if you want, as it should get a ""more accurate"" info.From what I've seen shouldn't be a problem as for most systems these values are the same, and it would now cover these weird cases(like mine) where they aren't.

Sure, here you go:
Before

# I will keep only 1 value in each command, as they're all the same, to keep this shorter
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq

3400000

                    <p>I've been experiencing the same issue, and I believe it's because the script takes some time to enable Turbo Boost, even when it's already set to `always`. As a result, `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq` is read before Turbo Boost is fully activated, showing the non-boosted value.

I resolved this by setting `turbo = auto` and controlling Turbo Boost manually using `scaling_max_freq` in the configuration file. In practice, setting `scaling_max_freq = 1600000` or lower is practically the same as disabling Turbo Boost in your case, both in terms of temperatures and power consumption (even when `--stats` reports `Setting turbo boost: on` ). On the other hand, setting `scaling_max_freq` to anything higher should function nearly identically to `turbo = always`, unless you're hitting extremely high temperatures and getting something like BD PROCHOT.</p>
