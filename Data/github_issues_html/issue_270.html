This seems to be caused by this line:
https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/a48e9193fab17134b0d6857f49a4225e44dff708/auto-cpufreq-installer#L129

Which does not properly execute leaving to an unmodified `auto-cpufreq.service` file in `/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts/auto-cpufreq.service` which I assume is then copied over when `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` is called.

Manually executing `sudo sed -i 's|ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq|ExecStart=/usr/bin/auto-cpufreq|' /usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts/auto-cpufreq.service` and then `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` again fixes the issue.

Edit:
The problem seems to be that the installer *tries to replace the line* before the files are copied to begin with, though I could be wrong since I dont have much experience with reading bash.

Specifically: 
https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/a48e9193fab17134b0d6857f49a4225e44dff708/auto-cpufreq-installer#L139
Calls
https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/a48e9193fab17134b0d6857f49a4225e44dff708/auto-cpufreq-installer#L62
Which copies the files *after* trying to replace the path
https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/a48e9193fab17134b0d6857f49a4225e44dff708/auto-cpufreq-installer#L40

Removing all leftovers with `sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq` and then calling `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer` to simulate a clean install via git clone will get the error `sed: can't read /usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts/auto-cpufreq.service: No such file or directory`. With subsequent installs replacing the line, but then being overwritten by the new copy.</p>

                    <p>@plexxman please pull the latest changes. @4JX made a contribution which fixes this issue and is now part of auto-cpufreq.</p>

                    <p>Roger that, I've reinstalled pulling the latest changes and it installs perfectly and the systemd service starts up without errors, the fix works.

Thank you very much to both.</p>
