I configured the configuration-file and set the max frequencies

But if i look in GUI, it doesn't seem like max frequency are respected? Do i see this correct?
Turboboost setting is respected.

                    <p>what method did you use to install auto-cpufreq? mabye you should try to use the auto-cpufreq driver found [here](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting)</p>

                    <p>any potential downsides on replacing intel pstate with auto-cpufreq driver? </p>

                    <p>update: config file settings worked after restarting the computer, `auto-cpufreq --config` by itself had no effect.</p>

[I've mentioned this same thing on Discord,](https://discord.com/channels/1158239366251020361/1158239367337349164/1211952577432916008). 

I think it would be great if auto-cpufreq Readme (config part) would be updated with "For best results, please restart after making changes to config file".

Same type of message should also be outputted after auto-cpufreq daemon is installed.  

I've added it to my (long) ToDo, but if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).
