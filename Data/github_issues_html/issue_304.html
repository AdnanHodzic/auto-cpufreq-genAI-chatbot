            <p><strong>Issue #304</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This removes the package options from the cpufreqctl.sh script. Because I believe they are not being used in this project. This to avoid confusion from people reading the source and then thinking auto-cpufreq will ship with fonts and what not.

                    <p>I originally wanted to keep `cpufreqctl.sh` as close to its original version, but now that auto-cpufreq is also using it's own version it doesn't make any sense to have functionality of this script which is not even used. 

Hence, excellent catch!</p>

                    <p>Do you want me to investigate some more on the usage of this script and remove some code? I was playing very safe with only the package options.

I mean the core functionality stands I guess, so no direct future usage of functions that aren't used at this point? Is that a correct assumption?</p>

Sure, I don't see a reason why not. However, if you're looking for something to pick up, check existing issues, there's **a lot** stuff that's low hanging fruit.

Yes, just make sure to thoroughly figure how it works and what's core functionality that's used in auto-cpufreq context.</p>
