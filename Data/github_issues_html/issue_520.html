Have you tried?

   [Searching through existing/closed issues](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues) to see if your bug has already been already submitted? 
Yes, found a similar closed issue with a very similar error, but there was no solution because the OP of the issue did not use the template provided. https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/429
    If installation failed with [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer),have you tried installing auto-cpufreq using [Snap package](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#snap-store)? 
I installed with snap from the beggining.
    Have you tried [configuring auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq)?
Yes, I have. (except I re-enabled daemon power profiles for now, to have atleast some power management. I turn it off when I try to fix the issue)
    Have you tried suggestions in [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#troubleshooting)?
    My issue is not prevelant in that page, since all of the troubleshooting in that page is only for already working auto-cpufreq.

For some reason my libinput config might not be letting auto-cpufreq run properly. That config is in place for me to reduce my touchpad scrolling speed and I am looking for a way for both of these to work at the same time. The problem with it is that it used to work fine, until one day I got an error that I pasted above. I followed these instructions to reduce my touchpad scrolling speed: https://gitlab.com/warningnonpotablewater/libinput-config. 
I do not have tlp, but I re-enabled daemon power profiles to atleast have some power management until I am able to fix this issue. As I can see from this error, it also cannot for some reason read the thread count of my cpu, so it just crashes. 

I tried: 
- Updating auto-cpufreq
- Reinstalling auto-cpufreq
- Reinstalling coreutils
- Clearing LD_PRELOAD environment variable (```export LD_PRELOAD=```)
