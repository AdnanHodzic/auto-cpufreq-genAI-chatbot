                    <p>Isn't it a snap only issue? After reading this comment from #240
> I got this error too when installing from Snap on Pop!OS 21.04. I was able to work around by installing with [git instead](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#auto-cpufreq-installer).

I've installed a VM with PopOS and the `distro` package from a python shell works just fine without changes.
If so it would be lot easier. On permission denied, detect file exists, detect snap, print solution.

Or just, permission denied, detect snap, if PopOS print solution and otherwise print open issue on github.

I think snap detection is like this:
```
if os.getenv("PKG_MARKER") == "SNAP":
   # we are in snap package
```

**I verified that this is only a snap issue because installing using the git installer does not have this problem**
So in the end, it's just the snap package that doesn't like the softlink from PopOS.

I think something like this will be enough:
```
except PermissionError:
    # Current work-around for Pop!_OS where symlink causes permission issues
    print("[!] Warning: Cannot get distro name")
    if os.path.exists("/etc/pop-os/os-release"):
            # Check if using a Snap 
            if os.getenv("PKG_MARKER") == "SNAP":
                print("[!] Snap install on PopOS detected, you must manually run the following" 
                        " commands in another terminal:\n")            
                print("[!] Backup the /etc/os-release file:")
                print("sudo mv /etc/os-release /etc/os-release-backup\n")                
                print("[!] Create hardlink to /etc/os-release:")
                print("sudo ln /etc/pop-os/os-release /etc/os-release\n")            
                print("[!] Aborting. Restart auto-cpufreq when you created the hardlink")
                sys.exit(1)
            else:
                # This should not be the case. But better be sure.
                print("[!] Check /etc/os-release permissions and make sure it is not a symbolic link")
                print("[!] Aborting...")
                sys.exit(1)

    else:
        print("[!] Check /etc/os-release permissions and make sure it is not a symbolic link")
        print("[!] Aborting...")
        sys.exit(1)
```

Thank you, great work!

```
The same snap on Ubuntu runs just without the warning message. I think it's just perfect.

Let's see what @AdnanHodzic thinks of it.

If go this route, lets not forget to remove these lines:

                    <p>I also think it's perfect! Great job @tyleraharrison and as always thank @bobslept for the assistance in review process :slightly_smiling_face:

I'll give Canonical folks few more days, but if it's not approved in few days when I'm doing a new release I'll take care of removing these lines.</p>
