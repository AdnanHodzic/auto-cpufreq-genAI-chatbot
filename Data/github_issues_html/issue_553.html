            <p><strong>Issue #553</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>As a fairly new user of NixOS, I found that the [current nixpkg](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-23.05/pkgs/tools/system/auto-cpufreq/default.nix) is very outdated.

After discovering this, I decided to package auto-cpufreq myself so I could enjoy it from the latest releases. Also as someone who has been helping develop parts of auto-cpufreq, I wanted to setup a Nix dev environment through a `flake.nix` file. I also rewrote my Nix package to work with the flake and created a NixOS module that any NixOS user can take advantage of. This will allow us to keep up with the latest changes of `auto-cpufreq` without worrying that the nixpkg is outdated.

Note that the `flake.lock` file will need to be updated every once in a while to keep up with changes to Python, packages, etc... This is super easy and I can take care of this as needed. It could even be setup automatically through a GitHub action if we so wish

In addition to the flake, I have updated the README to include info about how to install on NixOS and have updated `auto-cpufreq-installer` to exit and give the user a message upon detection of NixOS

In the meantime, I do plan on writing a PR to update the nixpkg to the latest release, but I still think this is a good change for the minority of Nix users :)
