            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When I run `auto-cpufreq --stats` or use the GUI, it reports to me “Not setting EPP (not supported by system)”. I, of course, had no doubt that my system supported this feature, so I went to check the source code.

Apparently, in [this line](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/fe296206462f204c3abb9d73e005fccd8c8a6bb6/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L677C19-L677C73), it checks whether the file `intel_pstate/hwp_dynamic_boost` exists — and if it does, reports this error message. That happened to be the case, but just checking whether the file exists isn't enough to accurately determine if dynamic boosting is enabled. The code should, in fact, check the contents of the file (whether a `0` or a `1`), and proceed from there.

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/hwp_dynamic_boost
0
```

```

                    <p>You're right, and in #619 I even mentioned seeing EPP just fine.

Since I'm very limited with available time to do this myself and [project is looking for contributors](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#looking-for-developers-and-co-maintainers) if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and [contribute to the project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution) and you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).</p>
