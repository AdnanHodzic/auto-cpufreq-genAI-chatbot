                <p>### Error output:

```
Autostart
```
Hi, 

I've installed auto-cpufreq via 

`git clone https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.git
cd auto-cpufreq && sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer`

I can run auto-cpufreq with sudo but how do I start it each time on boot? The instructions aren't very clear, maybe put it at the end of .bashrc ?

                    <p>Have you [read the ReadMe which explains this](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon) before declaring that instructions aren't clear? </p>

                    <p>Yes, I did, but I only saw some instructions for "AUR package (Arch/Manjaro Linux)", I am running Pop OS which is basically Ubuntu and the following instructions didn't work
`
systemctl start auto-cpufreq `to start the service. 

Unit auto-cpufreq.service could not be found.


`systemctl status auto-cpufreq `to see the status of service, 

Unit auto-cpufreq.service could not be found.


`systemctl enable auto-cpufreq` for service to persist running accross reboots.

Failed to enable unit: Unit file auto-cpufreq.service does not exist.</p>

                    <p>Nowhere did I make a reference to AUR, I gave a link which pointed to [Install - auto-cpufreq daemon](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon).

Once you [install auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#installing-auto-cpufreq), all you need to do is have it running on boot is: `sudo auto-cpufreq --install`. If you're having trouble following this refer to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg in which I go over all the modes. </p>

                    <p>I ran that command `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` but couldn't establish that the service was installed, I was a bit confused after installing from the binaries, anyway I watched your video and can can see that it is installed as a service now:

`sudo systemctl is-enabled auto-cpufreq.service` -> enabled
