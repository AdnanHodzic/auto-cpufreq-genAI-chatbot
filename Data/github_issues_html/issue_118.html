            <h1>Turbo boost enabled under low load</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #118</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Looks like auto-cpufreq is a bit overzealous when deciding the system is under high load. You can see my debug below, 1% CPU usage and 0.62 system load. As a result, turbo is on probably when it shoudln't and the laptop is running a few degrees hotter than it could.

Under the same sort of load, without running auto-cpufreq the system temp is around 45/47 degrees C.

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>Thanks for confirming this. As [I mentioned](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/109#issuecomment-691314410) in #109  currently `auto-cpufreq` is very "turbo mode" trigger friendly when charging. 

I've marked this bug as duplicate, and if possible let's continue this discussion in #109.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>@luispabon I made some [changes in turbo-lover](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/turbo-lover) branch, you can get them by installing `auto-cpufreq` from snap beta channel:

```
sudo snap install auto-cpufreq --beta
```

Now it's using more conservative settings and turbo isn't triggered as easily as before. Let me know how it works for you.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>luispabon:</strong></p>
                    <p>Copy that, I will do so as soon as I'm back to charging tomorrow :+1:</p>

                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>luispabon:</strong></p>
                    <p>@AdnanHodzic definitely much better than before.</p>

                    <p><strong>luispabon:</strong></p>
                    <p>Do you want to keep this open until the change is released to non-beta? Or should I just close it?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>> @AdnanHodzic definitely much better than before.

Good to hear, I could make turbo trigger even more conservative, but this seems like the right balance. 

> Do you want to keep this open until the change is released to non-beta? Or should I just close it?

Don't worry about it, once I've released 1.3.2 final and promoted build to snap stable channel, I'll close it myself. I want to test it more myself and for @marc0der  to confirm the same in #109

                    <p><strong>dnisyd:</strong></p>
                    <p>How about making it configurable which lets us use the default turbo boost load balance trigger or use a self defined threshold?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

                    <p>@dnisyd while I was working on this I was thinking about the same thing. This would be ideal candidate for #26, but I'm not sure when I'll have time to start working on it. 

Also, until #26 is implemented, we need to have good "defaults" for triggering turbo. What was there before was too "trigger happy" in terms of turning on turbo.</p>

                    <p>After thoroughly testing changes for few days, I've merged them with `master` branch and made [1.3.2 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3.2). These changes have also been promoted to snap `stable` channel. 

If you've been using beta channel you can switch to stable by running:

```
sudo snap switch --channel=stable auto-cpufreq
```
