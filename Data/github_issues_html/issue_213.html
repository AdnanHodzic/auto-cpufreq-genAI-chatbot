            <h1>[Request] User defined Max/Peak Frequencies for different scenarios</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #213</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>My request is;
To add a max frequency (You can choose any frequency the driver reports) when for example unplugged / plugged
- It would be nice if you can add an application that would override this
The purpose of this is to better manage thermals specially when launching programs that spike the cpu freq. or watching videos which would make the frequency jump up to 3ghz+ unnecessarily.
Here are my system specs (maybe it has to do with the cpu but if there be a way to make it better; I think is by doing the max. frequencies request) :

i5-7300u 
16gb ddr4 ram
Opensuse Tumbleweed

here is my frequency-info by cpupower;
aniki@Amethyst:~> sudo cpupower  frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  **hardware limits: 400 MHz - 3.50 GHz**
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 400 MHz and 2.60 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 1.42 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes

- I think that if i set a max frequency of 900mhz - 1.5ghz for example, itll fare better for my temps and itll keep the spikes at bay.

                    <p>With [v1.7.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.7.0) it's now possible to manually define some of the settings instead of leaving everything to be picked up automatically. Could you try tweaking some of the [available options](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#configuring-auto-cpufreq) and report back on how that worked for you? Thanks

In meantime I'll close the issue, please re-open it if the problem persists.</p>
