            <h1>Add min/max allowed frequencies option (#309)</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #324</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Setting the minimum/maximum allowed CPU frequencies is now possible
via 'scaling_min_freq' and 'scaling_max_freq' options in config
for both modes (charger and battery).
Values should be given in kHZ.

Example:
scaling_min_freq = 1800000
scaling_max_freq = 2000000

I also did autoformatting via 'black', using --line-length 100.
Code is now a bit tidier than before.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for your work on auto-cpufreq! When we have time we look into this.

One tip in general when contributing a feature. Don't run code formatters, do it as a seperate PR.
You now touched almost every file at multiple lines, which is not really easy for reviewing a new feature.

But overall, thank you!</p>

                    <p>Okay, I'll create a separate PR for the reformatted base commit of my feature, so once it's delivered I can rebase this one on it, for making it easier to read.

                    <p>From just reading the code it looks good! I will let the testing to @AdnanHodzic 

But I have one question, why do you use regex for this?
```
        # check if valid value is given
        freq_val = conf[section][freq_type].strip()
        if re.match(r"\d+$", freq_val) is None:
```

Would detecting a ValueError on int() not be easier?

</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>**1:** Code changes LGTM, but there's one problem where if there is no `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` file and therefor auto-cpufreq is not using it,  I'll still output following: 

```
Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file
```

**2:** When it comes to testing the changes. Setting the limits didn't seem to make any difference and it seems defined limits were not respected.

**3:** README/Example config contents:

```
# minimum cpu frequency (in kHz)
# example: for 1800 MHz -> scaling_min_freq = 1800000
scaling_min_freq = 1800000
# maximum cpu frequency (in kHz)
# example: for 2000 MHz -> scaling_max_freq = 2000000
scaling_max_freq = 2000000
```

**3.1:**

`# example: for 1800 MHz -> scaling_min_freq = 1800000`

I would lower `1800000` (1.8GHz) to `800000000` (800MHz). As there are a lot people with exotic hardware, and their max cpu frequency might not even be as high as 1.8Ghz.

**3.2:**

On this topic mentioned above, what should happen if I say `scaling_max_freq = 8000000` (8GHz) but my max cpu frequency is i.e 4GHz? Or if I define higher `scaling_min_freq ` then my cpu is capable of, i.e: `scaling_min_freq = 1800000` (1.8GHz) but my cpu max frequency is 1.2 GHz?

**3.3:**

I would disable/comment `scaling_min_freq` & `scaling_max_freq` lines by default. Adding a note under `# minimum cpu frequency (in kHz)` line to uncomment these for this functionality to work. As I have a feeling if user doesn't know what they are doing and have these values misconfigured these there'll will be lot more problems then benefits.

**3.4:**

MHz to Hz conversion can be bit configuring for a random Joe, so I would also add a link to i.e: [MHz to Hz conversion](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/frequency/mhz-to-hz.html) for further reference as part of the description.</p>

Good catch, thanks. A string.isidigit() check would also suffice.</p>

```
try:
   freq_val = int(conf[section][freq_type].strip())
except ValueError:
   # not integer
```
Should do it I think, that would make freq_val an int or raises an error when it couldn't make an int out if it.

                    <p>What is the difference between --frequency-min/max  and the new --frequency-min/max-limit in `cpufreqctl.sh` you implemented?
Seems to me they are exactly the same? 

Ah I see. One is cpuinfo_freq and the other is scaling_freq. On my system it gives the same results. Sorry.
But you set them via scaling_freq, wouldn't it be better to also get the scaling_freq then? I don't know for sure.</p>

If you're close to finishing I can also wait and do the release next week. If not we can also make these changes as part of a new release next year, it all works for me, just let me know so I can plan, thanks!</p>

Hi, with the latest commit, I consider it done, I think I implemented all changes suggested last time. I also tested it, works for me too.
So feel free to release it.</p>

                    <p>@varaki in meantime I found one bug which should be fixed. If you're using `scaling_min/max_freq`, and you don't want to use values for these variables anymore and you comment them out, or even delete the whole `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` file. The previously defined values will be picked up until computer is rebooted. 

It would be great if they could be reverted back to defaults, as soon as it's detected `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` is no longer there, or `scaling_min/max_freq` have been commented out.</p>

One way to reset the original frequencies, is the "comment out in the config, then reboot way".
Maybe we can reset the values by using the two newly implemented functions I used, to fetch the minimum/maximum possible values for frequencies as a sort of "sanity" check for this feature.
Okay, I can start working on it tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic,

How do we know whether the scaling frequencies were set by auto-cpufreq before or not?
Configuration file gets parsed only on startup and it's not being watched for changes during auto-cpufreq is running.
Should we always check whether the scaling min/max freqs differ from the defaults?
I'll figure out something that's resource friendly and doesn't do any checks/settings more than it's necessary, but looking at auto-cpufreq as a whole, I think re-organizing it into a class based structure would help a lot in general for long-term.
