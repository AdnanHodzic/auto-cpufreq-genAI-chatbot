                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hello ! I'm testing this program, but so far, so good. Although, I found a problem and resolved it.
When I first installed it with 'snap', when running with 'sudo the auto-cpufreq --live', I was getting permission denied when trying to make changes.
I removed it and re-installed using the source code. Then, everything changed as supposed too. 

[my small contribution, even though I don't now if it's a know issue...]
Cheers!</p>

                    <p>Thank you. As I [indicated due to changes that needed to be done to snapd](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store). `snap` package is currently only encouraged on 20.04. </p>
