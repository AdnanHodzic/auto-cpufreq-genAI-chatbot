            <h1>fix for asus_expertBook_charging_threshold</h1>
            <p><strong>Issue #882</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>My Asus Expertbook laptop use charge_control_end_threshold path instead of charge_stop_threshold
i added charge_control_end_threshold path as a fallback path
and i also add that path to system_info file.
current implementation works with my laptop
Please let me know if any changes are needed.</p>

                    <p>@PurpleWazard since you implemented baterry threshold feature, could you please give it a ✅️ from your side before I merge it?

Thanks!</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic @sgimres i left notes in the review.  i think that change made to `system_info.py` should be made its own PR to be reviewed.  its out of scope of just battery thresholds.</p>

                    <p>My bad, my editor uses ruff to auto format python files.
And as per your advice, I split this PR into two separate PRs.
#883 
#884
