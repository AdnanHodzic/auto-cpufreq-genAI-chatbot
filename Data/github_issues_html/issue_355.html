                    <p>How did you install auto-cpufreq? I would recommend to use the stable AUR version, which should work on manjaro.
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/auto-cpufreq</p>

I tired AUR version (both git and not git version) and they had the same issue, so I tried building from source and the issue still persists.</p>

                    <p>The git version from AUR will not work. It isn't being updated. Using stable AUR package just works for me.
Be sure to remove the installed source version:
```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove
sudo pamac build auto-cpufreq
sudo systemctl enable --now auto-cpufreq
```

I cannot look into this because i'm not on manjaro system and using VM's to troubleshoot this is not working.
If you could restart the service, see when it stops and then find in the `journalctl --since "5 minutes ago"` if you see anything why it stopped? For me on a VM ofcourse it doesn't have access to certain things, so it would crash at those points.</p>
