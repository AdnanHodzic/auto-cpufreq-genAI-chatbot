                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I did the same question for thermald, now I ask for tuned. There is any overlap between two solutions? auto-cpufreq was projected to replace TLP, but there is any problem to use with tuned?

                    <p>No overlap, they should work fine in tandem. </p>

                    <p>I tested "tuned" today and now it appears to be incompatible with "auto-cpufreq".

Maybe something in the new release, v2.23.0, of "tuned".

Anyone can confirm this too?</p>
