<p><strong>0.29 - 5.61 seconds:</strong> so what do we have on this side of the</p>
<p><strong>3.03 - 9.03 seconds:</strong> screen is just battery monitoring tool</p>
<p><strong>5.61 - 11.22 seconds:</strong> and it says that my computer is charging</p>
<p><strong>9.03 - 13.05 seconds:</strong> which is correct and we'll get back to</p>
<p><strong>11.22 - 15.75 seconds:</strong> that later what do we have on this side</p>
<p><strong>13.05 - 20.85 seconds:</strong> of the screen is just we're gonna start</p>
<p><strong>15.75 - 23.61 seconds:</strong> up my auto CPU Frank CPU freak tool</p>
<p><strong>20.85 - 25.14 seconds:</strong> whatever you want to call it so if I run</p>
<p><strong>23.61 - 27.45 seconds:</strong> in I'm gonna see list of options</p>
<p><strong>25.14 - 30.39 seconds:</strong> it says automatic CPU speed and power</p>
<p><strong>27.45 - 32.31 seconds:</strong> optimizer for Linux which is true and it</p>
<p><strong>30.39 - 35.13 seconds:</strong> comes in several modes but we'll go</p>
<p><strong>32.31 - 37.41 seconds:</strong> through them later so if we look at the</p>
<p><strong>35.13 - 40.17 seconds:</strong> first one monitor it says monitor such</p>
<p><strong>37.41 - 45.41 seconds:</strong> as CPU optimization so what happens if I</p>
<p><strong>40.17 - 47.70 seconds:</strong> run that so we see system information</p>
<p><strong>45.41 - 51.78 seconds:</strong> basically we see the Linux distribution</p>
<p><strong>47.70 - 54.39 seconds:</strong> we're using Linux kernel version CPU</p>
<p><strong>51.78 - 59.31 seconds:</strong> driver architecture processor number of</p>
<p><strong>54.39 - 62.49 seconds:</strong> cores maximum CPU frequency that's one</p>
<p><strong>59.31 - 64.26 seconds:</strong> it can go up to and this is what the</p>
<p><strong>62.49 - 66.69 seconds:</strong> frequency is for each for right now and</p>
<p><strong>64.26 - 69.09 seconds:</strong> temperature for each core and it says</p>
<p><strong>66.69 - 71.22 seconds:</strong> battery is charging which is correct and</p>
<p><strong>69.09 - 73.59 seconds:</strong> what it corresponds to what we saw here</p>
<p><strong>71.22 - 75.42 seconds:</strong> and it's suggesting to you as</p>
<p><strong>73.59 - 77.00 seconds:</strong> performance governor and that's what</p>
<p><strong>75.42 - 79.98 seconds:</strong> it's currently using</p>
<p><strong>77.00 - 84.18 seconds:</strong> we also see the total CPU usage and</p>
<p><strong>79.98 - 86.40 seconds:</strong> system load and currently says turbo</p>
<p><strong>84.18 - 91.83 seconds:</strong> boost is on and that's what it suggests</p>
<p><strong>86.40 - 95.52 seconds:</strong> to do so okay that's great but what</p>
<p><strong>91.83 - 97.92 seconds:</strong> happens and to get into the problem that</p>
<p><strong>95.52 - 101.31 seconds:</strong> I had would have been a CPU frequency</p>
<p><strong>97.92 - 103.98 seconds:</strong> scaling right now is that if I change</p>
<p><strong>101.31 - 107.43 seconds:</strong> states for example I'm gonna pull the</p>
<p><strong>103.98 - 111.84 seconds:</strong> power out out of my laptop and if I do</p>
<p><strong>107.43 - 115.05 seconds:</strong> that if we look it's gonna say that it's</p>
<p><strong>111.84 - 116.88 seconds:</strong> discharging right now and basically if I</p>
<p><strong>115.05 - 119.40 seconds:</strong> look here that's also what my tool is</p>
<p><strong>116.88 - 121.74 seconds:</strong> going to say and it's also literally</p>
<p><strong>119.40 - 125.16 seconds:</strong> gonna suggest to use power say governor</p>
<p><strong>121.74 - 127.95 seconds:</strong> instead of performance and because of</p>
<p><strong>125.16 - 130.62 seconds:</strong> the load which we see here it's going to</p>
<p><strong>127.95 - 132.48 seconds:</strong> say suggesting to set turbo boost off</p>
<p><strong>130.62 - 135.60 seconds:</strong> and it's still from the</p>
<p><strong>132.48 - 139.77 seconds:</strong> and maximum CP or you can see it still</p>
<p><strong>135.60 - 141.54 seconds:</strong> its maximum and basically this is what</p>
<p><strong>139.77 - 144.06 seconds:</strong> the goals of course are running at so</p>
<p><strong>141.54 - 148.35 seconds:</strong> basically you will lose a lot of power</p>
<p><strong>144.06 - 151.08 seconds:</strong> and you need to preserve it so that's my</p>
<p><strong>148.35 - 153.36 seconds:</strong> major problem and there's a lot of tools</p>
<p><strong>151.08 - 155.73 seconds:</strong> which allow you to do that CPU frequency</p>
<p><strong>153.36 - 158.64 seconds:</strong> scaling but if you have to tweak it and</p>
<p><strong>155.73 - 161.82 seconds:</strong> I just want to use the computer instead</p>
<p><strong>158.64 - 164.58 seconds:</strong> of a keep constantly tweaking it you can</p>
<p><strong>161.82 - 166.44 seconds:</strong> also use a tools like TLP but they also</p>
<p><strong>164.58 - 168.03 seconds:</strong> come with their set of problems and</p>
<p><strong>166.44 - 172.11 seconds:</strong> something I've been using for a number</p>
<p><strong>168.03 - 175.17 seconds:</strong> of years so if I didn't just make the</p>
<p><strong>172.11 - 179.13 seconds:</strong> monitoring tool let's see what else is</p>
<p><strong>175.17 - 182.52 seconds:</strong> there so basically what monitor did is</p>
<p><strong>179.13 - 185.22 seconds:</strong> it monitors the system and makes</p>
<p><strong>182.52 - 187.41 seconds:</strong> suggestions and right now live is the</p>
<p><strong>185.22 - 190.17 seconds:</strong> next mode which says monitor and makes</p>
<p><strong>187.41 - 191.22 seconds:</strong> adjust the subscriptions Asian's so</p>
<p><strong>190.17 - 194.73 seconds:</strong> let's see what it does</p>
<p><strong>191.22 - 198.99 seconds:</strong> so I program it we get a say information</p>
<p><strong>194.73 - 202.05 seconds:</strong> and immediately we see it's setting to</p>
<p><strong>198.99 - 205.44 seconds:</strong> use Power Save and it because the load</p>
<p><strong>202.05 - 207.90 seconds:</strong> is optimal based on this it said the</p>
<p><strong>205.44 - 210.63 seconds:</strong> turbo boost off which is good and</p>
<p><strong>207.90 - 213.69 seconds:</strong> maximum CPU frequency is nearly lowered</p>
<p><strong>210.63 - 216.45 seconds:</strong> and frequency for each color is also a</p>
<p><strong>213.69 - 218.82 seconds:</strong> lot lower which will basically allow me</p>
<p><strong>216.45 - 222.56 seconds:</strong> to preserve battery life instead of</p>
<p><strong>218.82 - 226.89 seconds:</strong> computer just running at its maximum</p>
<p><strong>222.56 - 230.82 seconds:</strong> potential maximum speed and power so</p>
<p><strong>226.89 - 234.72 seconds:</strong> that's great and what so I can go even</p>
<p><strong>230.82 - 237.09 seconds:</strong> lower of course because basically tool</p>
<p><strong>234.72 - 239.70 seconds:</strong> doesn't do anything except change the</p>
<p><strong>237.09 - 242.07 seconds:</strong> power states the governor since CP or</p>
<p><strong>239.70 - 244.38 seconds:</strong> scaling is still less than when I scroll</p>
<p><strong>242.07 - 247.38 seconds:</strong> don't do the heavy lifting so let's see</p>
<p><strong>244.38 - 250.73 seconds:</strong> if I just stress the CPU a little bit</p>
<p><strong>247.38 - 250.73 seconds:</strong> what's gonna happen and</p>
<p><strong>251.09 - 259.67 seconds:</strong> so immediately we should see that CP was</p>
<p><strong>255.76 - 262.37 seconds:</strong> 100 and it says the turbo boosters are</p>
<p><strong>259.67 - 264.41 seconds:</strong> now because they detect it needs more</p>
<p><strong>262.37 - 266.62 seconds:</strong> power and same thing is with the CPU</p>
<p><strong>264.41 - 269.72 seconds:</strong> frequency so I want to stop it and</p>
<p><strong>266.62 - 273.89 seconds:</strong> switches and it starts using what NHC</p>
<p><strong>269.72 - 276.08 seconds:</strong> use which is great and it's still in</p>
<p><strong>273.89 - 278.81 seconds:</strong> power save of course and once the load</p>
<p><strong>276.08 - 281.81 seconds:</strong> is down it will turn the boot</p>
<p><strong>278.81 - 287.06 seconds:</strong> turbo boost off and same thing is with</p>
<p><strong>281.81 - 289.70 seconds:</strong> the frequency and well thinking maybe</p>
<p><strong>287.06 - 293.72 seconds:</strong> next iteration or next two iterations</p>
<p><strong>289.70 - 297.65 seconds:</strong> will see it go down to turbo boost off</p>
<p><strong>293.72 - 301.16 seconds:</strong> and I'll wait actually for this and</p>
<p><strong>297.65 - 303.92 seconds:</strong> Satan is off and that's exactly what we</p>
<p><strong>301.16 - 307.52 seconds:</strong> wanted and maximum frequency is also</p>
<p><strong>303.92 - 311.15 seconds:</strong> down so that's great but basically</p>
<p><strong>307.52 - 313.37 seconds:</strong> whatever you will run in log mode all</p>
<p><strong>311.15 - 315.11 seconds:</strong> the changes that it does once you'll</p>
<p><strong>313.37 - 318.32 seconds:</strong> reboot the computer they're gonna go</p>
<p><strong>315.11 - 320.36 seconds:</strong> back to their defaults so that's why</p>
<p><strong>318.32 - 322.58 seconds:</strong> install option is there which is going</p>
<p><strong>320.36 - 329.81 seconds:</strong> to install demon or automatic CP</p>
<p><strong>322.58 - 333.20 seconds:</strong> optimizations so let's install it if I</p>
<p><strong>329.81 - 336.92 seconds:</strong> could just spell that correctly and yeah</p>
<p><strong>333.20 - 339.83 seconds:</strong> basically turns don't tooth off on boot</p>
<p><strong>336.92 - 343.52 seconds:</strong> you can still run it just preserve</p>
<p><strong>339.83 - 346.58 seconds:</strong> battery and it deploys well we can read</p>
<p><strong>343.52 - 348.55 seconds:</strong> what it does it's also system D service</p>
<p><strong>346.58 - 351.23 seconds:</strong> that's how it runs</p>
<p><strong>348.55 - 354.62 seconds:</strong> you can mean this Li it on your own but</p>
<p><strong>351.23 - 357.44 seconds:</strong> what's important is that this part where</p>
<p><strong>354.62 - 359.75 seconds:</strong> it says it's installing running so</p>
<p><strong>357.44 - 361.49 seconds:</strong> because we don't see anything what's</p>
<p><strong>359.75 - 364.28 seconds:</strong> happening and but it's running in the</p>
<p><strong>361.49 - 366.25 seconds:</strong> background so let's see the log and</p>
<p><strong>364.28 - 368.87 seconds:</strong> fantasticks know there's a little bit</p>
<p><strong>366.25 - 372.02 seconds:</strong> basically we see that it's running and</p>
<p><strong>368.87 - 376.03 seconds:</strong> we see the live log of what it's doing</p>
<p><strong>372.02 - 381.25 seconds:</strong> so let's also power in the backend and</p>
<p><strong>376.03 - 386.06 seconds:</strong> will see immediately that battery is</p>
<p><strong>381.25 - 390.80 seconds:</strong> charging now and yeah maximum frequency</p>
<p><strong>386.06 - 393.32 seconds:</strong> should also now change yep and yeah</p>
<p><strong>390.80 - 396.41 seconds:</strong> great so that's exactly what it does so</p>
<p><strong>393.32 - 399.59 seconds:</strong> I don't need to do any tweaking it just</p>
<p><strong>396.41 - 402.11 seconds:</strong> does everything for me and I can just</p>
<p><strong>399.59 - 405.65 seconds:</strong> use a computer so this was my big</p>
<p><strong>402.11 - 408.29 seconds:</strong> problem and that's why I decided to make</p>
<p><strong>405.65 - 412.40 seconds:</strong> this tool and make it by what hardly</p>
<p><strong>408.29 - 415.88 seconds:</strong> accessible for anybody to use and yeah</p>
<p><strong>412.40 - 419.77 seconds:</strong> download it and enjoy it and please let</p>
<p><strong>415.88 - 419.77 seconds:</strong> me know if you have any questions</p>
