                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Note the inclusion of my username - i'm unsure of this specific aspect. Also take note of the request to leave an issue on this repo - the only other method for me to know if something is wrong is through AUR comments. 

I moved the Gnome Power Profiles Daemon issue from `#Troubleshooting` to the `###AUR package` as this made more sense to me. it is also baked into the arch installer. 

I also made note of when both AUR repos where last updated- I don't have control over the git repo so its worth mentioning the difference. FWIW its also marked as out of date on the AUR and was last updated last year.</p>

I think this is good, even preferable as if anyone has any questions they can reach out directly to you, either in Discussion/Issues section or Discord server.

Ack, just be aware this will also be mentioned here:

> 1: power_helper.py script (Snap package install only)
When installing auto-cpufreq via [auto-cpufreq-installer](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/9c5701eeca3cc7986058241fb16ece3ed1187fa2/README.md#auto-cpufreq-installer), if it detects the [GNOME Power Profiles service](https://twitter.com/fooctrl/status/1467469508373884933) is running, it will automatically disable it. Otherwise, that daemon will cause conflicts and various other performance issues.

Ack, LGTM! 

Thank you for your contribution, I'll update the [v2.1.0 release ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases) and add you there, instead of making a new v2.1.1.</p>
