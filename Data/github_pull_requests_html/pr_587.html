                <p>![20231025_15h35m12s_grim](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/assets/31134255/2ab68043-8c0c-43ff-99c7-63be8f20e132)


I brought this up in the Discord and started working on it. 

Changes
- renamed `verify_update` to `check_for_update` and will now return True if an update was found
- GUI will prompt for an update if `check_for_update()` returns True
- Calls `auto-cpufreq --update` in the background

In order to test this, you need to edit the version to something less than 2.0.0 in `pyproject.toml` and reinstall or update what the version function returns in `core.py`</p>
