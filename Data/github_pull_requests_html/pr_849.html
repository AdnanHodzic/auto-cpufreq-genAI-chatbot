Hi ! @AdnanHodzic 

My current fork branch (*master*) is 2 commits ahead of this -> AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq:master.

It's just a consistency issue 🧐.  </p>

                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I see the changes, but I don't see any changes being made. Let's merge this as well as see if anything changes.</p>

@AdnanHodzic !  The second merge didn’t do the trick, so I had to fix it another way. All good now ✅.

Thanks !</p>

                    <p>Yes, I was about to suggest that problem is probably on your side and that you needed to do a rebase, but I merged it anyway. But regardless, all good :) </p>
