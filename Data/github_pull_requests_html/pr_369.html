                <p>The scripts are installed at `/usr/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts` not `/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/scripts`

Otherwise, this error will occur,

                    <p>Hi @mizzunet, thank you for looking into this as original contributors stopped making changes for `openrc` and `runit`. In meantime a lot changed when virtual python env for auto-cpufreq was introduced as part of [1.9.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

I left single comment if we can resolve that then we can merge with merge of this and #370</p>

                    <p>No, I was wrong. The PKGBUILD completely wrong :o

AUR installs `scripts` folder to `/usr/share/auto-cpufreq/`

Whereas `auto-cpufreq-installer` installs the same folder at `/usr/local/share/auto-cpufreq/` 
Not sure about snap though

In that case, it's PKGBUILD to be editted. I don't know, how do I edit from repo.
 So, I'm closing this.</p>
