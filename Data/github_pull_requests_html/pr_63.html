            <p><strong>Pull Request #63</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>fixes #17

- Added get_avail_powersave() (and performance).
  This function returns the most energy(and performance) efficient governor.
  This should fix AMD issue when powersave is not available
  but "ondemand" or "schedutil" are present

- Cleaned up and refactored.
  Added more convenient util functions.
  Also made it more pythonic, reduced subprocess calls, made it more modular

- Added support for setting turbo boost for AMD and Intel (intel_pstate and cpufreq driver)

- Tested on Intel and AMD machines and it works fine
    - It at least doesn't  fail
    - performance/powersave is 
    - turbo is switching on high CPU load.

- It needs more testing</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic  please, don't review it. Just tried it on amd and have issues.</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic now I tested it on AMD and fixed all related errors.
Didn't test snap version, as I have POP! OS

                    <p>I would suggest to "squash merge" as I did a lot of garbage commits that should not be displayed in the master :)</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I'll definitely squash it before merging, so no worries about how many commits you make :)

However, I have problem testing the changes:

```
git checkout -b "Red-Eyed-fix_\#17_amd" "master"
fatal: 'Red-Eyed-fix_\#17_amd' is not a valid branch name.
git checkout -b "Red-Eyed:fix_#17_amd" "master"
fatal: 'Red-Eyed:fix_#17_amd' is not a valid branch name.
```

Could you maybe change the branch name so it doesn't have `#` in it (which I think is the problem with `bash`)?</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic thanks for mentioned me in Release Notes!
I would change description for AMD: `acpitz` -> [k10temp](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/k10temp)</p>

Of course! I had to find a way to thank you for the effort you put into this release :)
