            <h1>Rework config and reload config on file change/creation/deletion</h1>
            <p><strong>Pull Request #663</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This PR reworks the config into its own class/file and introduces config reloads when the config file is changed, created, or deleted. This also introduces the utils folder to remove some clutter from `core.py`

The file watching is done using the `pyinotify` package which I've added as a Nix dependency and Poetry dependency. All file watching is done in a separate thread so that the daemon isn't blocked

Rather than using the old `get_config()` function which relied on setting a static attribute to the function, this uses a new `_Config()` class, but the config is actually accessed by importing `config` from the `config.py` file. This allows the config to be accessed from any file, basically as a singleton. `_Config()` should NEVER be accessed directly


This change can be tested by running the daemon, running `auto-cpufreq --stats`, then editing your config file. You should see the changes take place live in the stats window without any sort of daemon reload.</p>

                    <p>Good stuff with a lot of potential! 

Good thing is that it when writing to auto-cpufreq file, changes are immediately reflected and picked up. However if I do `sudo mv /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf /tmp` changes weren't picked up and it was still picking up the last defined values from config file even with file not being there anymore.

Also, after auto-cpufreq-installer auto-cpufreq GUI wasn't there, nor was it available after `auto-cpufreq --install`. Also, after `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install` I had to do run CTRL+C, as otherwise terminal was still "open" and not available to run new commands, i.e:

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --install

Thanks @shadeyg56 I'm on my way to KubeCon today and will take a look once I'm back. @PurpleWazard if you could take a look and see if it works on your side until then that would be great. Thanks!</p>

This is happening on Ubuntu 24.04 with Python 3.12.3. Could it also be related with [pyinotify and removal of `asyncore` in 3.12? ](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues/916)</p>

Ah, yes I had been running on 3.10. I wasn't aware that would happen in 3.12. The `pyinotify` package hasn't been committed to in 9 years, so I took the liberty of making [my own fork](https://github.com/shadeyg56/pyinotify-3.12/) and removing the `asyncore` module so that it will work in 3.12

In e3678c1, I swapped the normal `pyinotify` dependency from PyPi for my git fork.</p>

Our of sheer curiosity, why did you end up opting to use `pyinotify` in this case considering no one has been committed to it in 9 years? Hoping this doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities, although it should only be watching for changes in one paritcular path/file `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` so it shouldn't be that much of an issue.  

Also maybe a good idea to propose your fork back to upstream?

It all works as expected now! This has been a great improvement and will be a big feature as part of upcoming release, hence needless to say thank you for your contribution!

Yeah, when I was looking for the best way to monitor files the two solutions I found were watchdog and inotify. Watchdog seemed more complicated than we needed it for and I saw that inotify was specifically for Linux only and was a part of the kernel itself. I guess pyinotify seemed like the more "Linux" way to do it, which seemed good to me seeing as `auto-cpufreq` is a Linux tool. Since pyinotify is really just a wrapper around Linux's inotify API, it makes sense that there hasn't been a need for any changes

I believe somebody already made a PR of what I did (we are not the only ones to run into this issue), but I don't expect it to be merged due to lack of activity on the repo.</p>
