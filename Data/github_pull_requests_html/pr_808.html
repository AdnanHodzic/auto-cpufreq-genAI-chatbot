                    <p>One small remark, can you please make a change to set `python311-setuptools` as `python3-setuptools`? As this way it won't be limited by particular Python version and will always get the latest, preventing the problem that occured in #805 from happening in future again.

                    <p>Actually python3-setuptools are being maped to some old 54 version or something 

the latest version available for OpenSUSE is available as python311-setuptools-75.6.0-2.2.noarch 

If python3-setuptools were tried to be installed it caused a conflict and the installation setup to fail.



Problem: 1: the installed python311-setuptools-75.6.0-2.2.noarch obsoletes 'python3-setuptools < 75.6.0-2.2' provided by the to be installed python3-setuptools-57.0.0-1.55.noarch

                    <p>Clear, weird that Suse is doing it like that instead of linking python metapackage to its latest version. 

Regardless, rest LGTM and thank you for your contribution, you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

Closes: #805</p>

                    <p>Thanks a bunch, if you have any specific things if you wanna delegate to me I would be happy to work on</p>

                    <p>Thank, best thing to do is take a look at [Looking for developers and co-maintainers](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#looking-for-developers-and-co-maintainers) section of README, or [my latest comment](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions/312#discussioncomment-9556465) in #312</p>

                    <p>Oh I did, honestly it's my first time so starting on alone to develop a new part of this project would be a little daunting, I would feel more in line if you could just delegate some task with some tips on how would I go about completing it.

Sorry for being a little inflexible </p>

                    <p>Sure, I can keep your name on when new issues come in, but there's a lot of [existing open ones](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen) so please check if there's any interesting for you. In meantime I would recommend to subscribe to all[ auto-cpufreq issues ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues.)so you're notified when there's a new one.

Also, please note just yesterday I released [auto-cpufreq-genAI-chatbot ](https://foolcontrol.org/?p=4903) and try to also use it for some things :) </p>
