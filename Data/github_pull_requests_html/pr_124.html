            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Adresses #85  and #108.

The solution I opted for was reading from AC-adapters and laptop batteries in /sys/class/power_supply/. With some configurations this can become a tad messy however (altho there's no other way to do this automatically afaik). Psutil actually reads from this directory, but it doesn't take into account some scenarios.

Looking into it I've seen the following kind of devices in this directory:

**AC Adapters**
- ACAD
- AC
- AC0
- ADP0
- ADP1

**Laptop Batteries**
- BAT0
- BAT1

**Peripheral Batteries** (mice, etc)
- hidpp_battery
- hidpp_battery_2
- battery_hid_somethingsomethingsomething_battery

There is also the case where a laptop has two ac-adapters and/or two batteries, and the case where the kernel can't properly read battery and/or ac-adapter information due to firmware issues. Which while investigating, turned out to be the case for my own laptop:

dmesg:
battery: ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT1] (battery present)
battery: [Firmware Bug]: battery: (dis)charge rate invalid.

Resulting in battery status 'Unknown' (when battery fully charged), and also psutil wrongly deciding it's charging state.

In the "weird" case that both ac-adapter and battery status are unknown by the kernel the function defaults to returning False which I thought appropriate (erring on the safe side). Also opted for using grep's output, because it looked too messy doing it with python.

I'd like your opinion on these liberties I've taken. Also I'd like some verification on other machines.</p>

                    <p>I've tested the changes and they work fine for me. Code wise, also fine with "liberties" you've taken :)

I've also pushed changes to snap "beta" channel, let's see if it does anything for reports in #85 and #108 after which I can merge it with master. </p>

                    <p>It's been verified that this fixes the issue for those affected in #108, merging the changes with `master` and making it part of [1.3.4 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3.4). Thanks for you contribution! </p>
