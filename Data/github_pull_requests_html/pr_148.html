                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Now auto-cpufreq will write directly to the logfile (if running as a daemon) or stdout.
The file (instead of just stdout) will automatically be cleared when on each refresh.

I am not that experienced with python and did test this for a decent while.</p>

                    <p>Considering some big changes were made as part of #150, #151, #152. #153 and I would like these changes to be part of [next 1.5.3 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).  In order to avoid conflicts, could you just make sure you have latest changes as part of this PR, thanks!</p>
