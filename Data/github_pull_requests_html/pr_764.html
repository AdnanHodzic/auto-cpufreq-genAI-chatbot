                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Michal and I have been using auto-cpufreq on Gentoo for quite some time. I absolutely love it. I recently became a contributor to GURU (Gentoo's official community-maintained ebuild repository, where users can compile non-standard apps missing in the main repo). I added the most recent versions of auto-cpufreq to this repository, which have been recently merged into GURU's master branch.

This is why I wanted to add this section: to expand auto-cpufreq's reach and make it available to more people. I'm willing to maintain these ebuilds for as long as I can.  I would be more than glad to fix issues ASAP in case they appear.

Thanks for your time and consideration. Let me know if there are any issues.</p>

                    <p>Awesome, great stuff. Could you just please extend at the end by simply adding something like: "Maintainer @S41G0N"

As something similar is done for i.e: 
> The AUR [Release Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/auto-cpufreq) is currently being maintained by [MusicalArtist12](https://github.com/MusicalArtist12), [liljaylj](https://github.com/liljaylj), and [parmjotsinghrobot](https://github.com/parmjotsinghrobot).

Makes it simpler to know who to contact in case of package issues.</p>

Certainly!  I just made the changes you suggested. I added links for users to check the source code of the ebuild and other relevant contacts such as my GitHub account or Gentoo's Bugzilla link in case they wanna file a bug report. I also made it a bit more readable and less verbose.

Have a good day.</p>
