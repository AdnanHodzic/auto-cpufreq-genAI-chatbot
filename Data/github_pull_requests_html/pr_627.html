                    <p>Thank you for the PR, since these changes seem strictly AMD oriented, I've asked [on auto-cpufreq discord channel](https://discord.gg/Sjauxtj6kH) if someone could test these changes.</p>

                    <p>Tried on my laptop with a Ryzen 7 and looks like it's not apearing anymore on journalctl but I have the same problem where on auto-cpufreq it shows that it can set EPP because it not supported

                    <p>@Tresillo2017 this issue was fixed with #631 can you make sure you have pulled the latest changes on `master` branch? </p>

                    <p>I'm not sure this is related to #631 since that was a fix for Intel CPUs.

You're using the `acpi-cpufreq` driver which does not support EPP, so this is not a bug. If you would like EPP support, you'll need to switch to using `amd-pstate-epp`</p>

And how can I do that? By not typing anything into the grub parameters?</p>
