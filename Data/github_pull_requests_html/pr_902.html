                <p>Fix: wrong variable name venv_path → VENV_PATH in script

Because the environment variable was misspelled (venv_path instead of VENV_PATH), the script never detected the directory and therefore failed to remove the folder. This commit fixes the variable name so the directory is correctly deleted.</p>
