                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Partially addresses #119.

Fixed total core number reporting, cpu numbering and temperatures, and now disabled cores are reported if any. Also tried sticking to the core/cpu definitions in linux topology tooling for variable naming this time.

What do you think, should we report real overall max and min frequencies, or report these frequency limits for each core?

                    <p>I left the min/max frequency reporting as it was (overall min and max), but mayhaps, if this tool ever modifies per core frequency limits, reporting it as a table may be preferable. Psutil seems very unreliable when reporting stuff with disabled cpus, so I'm now reading percpu current frequencies from /proc/cpuinfo. I'm know changes should work on AMD processors as well.</p>

                    <p>I'm sorry for such delayed reply. Changes look good and reasonable to me. I think `psutil` in this case might've also been responsible for "overheating" problem which I attempted to resolve in [1.3.2 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.3.2).

Only problem is once I build a snap out of these changes, I get an error:

```

But, this is a problem with Snap's interface management in strict confinement. In meantime until I figure this out, could you move "Temperature" to be after "Usage" column, this way "Frequency" will be to most right. And could also grant me permissions so I could also push to this branch?

Thanks</p>

                    <p>I'm not familiar with snap's  interface management, would reading from /sys/devices/system/ instead of using nproc circumvent this problem?

                    <p>I've managed to fix snap build problems, but now the changes have been pushed into a new [Hapstein-master](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/Haptein-master) branch. Regardless, I want to do more testing today and then I'll merge the changes with master and queue them for next 1.3.3 release.</p>
