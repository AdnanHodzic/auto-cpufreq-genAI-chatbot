                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>`cpufreqctl.auto-cpufreq` was deployed everywhere except on `auto-cpufreq --debug`. 

It was only removed when it was deployed as part of the daemon install. 

Now it's always removed when using the `auto-cpufreq-install --remove` option.</p>

Another excellent catch, I pushed 2 minor changes in the meantime. It seems like I was reviewing changes on #347 branch and then made my changes on top of it and push it all. Either way changes have been reverted, since PR is still open.</p>
