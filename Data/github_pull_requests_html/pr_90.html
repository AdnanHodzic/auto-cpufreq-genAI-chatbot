                <p>Install, *then* use. Not the other way around. Now it's clearer for folks using the AUR package they can just start using it. The AUR package install file notifies the user there is a service. Keep It Simple.</p>

                    <p>The help message is another issue. This at least makes the README clearer.</p>

                    <p>I reverted changes made with this PR.

@yochananmarqos with this change we catered whole README to those who installed `auto-cpufreq` using AUR. 

What is described here, doesn't apply to people who used `snap` or `auto-cpufreq-installer`. What is *simple* to you, doesn't mean it applies and is simple in every other use case. 

I think it would be a better idea to extend "[Arch Linux](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#arch-linux)" section, and say after "AUR package installation ____" fill in the blanks. As from what I see #84 and #91 after AUR installation, `auto-cpufreq --install` will be automatically run and just the `systemctl` needs to be enabled?

If this is true, I didn't know that was the case with AUR package. In my opinion and to keep things consistent as they are with `snap` and `auto-cpufreq-installer`. It would be the best if after AUR package installation, `auto-cpufreq` would be available as a binary, and then you have an option to run it `live` or `install` or whatever you want to do with it.

Let's discuss discuss some more. 

@Red-Eyed for the time being, could you please leave merging PR's to `master` to me? Thanks</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic there is no point in making such a AUR package, where you have manually install things. Then you can build the whole thing from source. 

The AUR package installs things into its path so the package manager (pacman) keeps track of these files. For example: if you remove the package all files will also be removed without manual intervention.</p>

                    <p>@crian right, okay. In that case as I suggested in #84, let's simply extend README to have what needs to be done when AUR package is installed and that's it.</p>

                    <p>[README ](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq)updated, I hope this clarifies any confusion. Please submit a new PR if you think otherwise. </p>
