            <h1>[BUG-FIX] Fixed bug related to recurring sudo prompt for functions that even don't require it</h1>
            <p><strong>Pull Request #531</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The `set_override` function is always called irrespective of the force flag is called or not. This in turn, required root checks for every flag calls, even for `auto-cpufreq --version`.

To fix it, now `set_override` method is now called only if force flag is invoked.
Also root_check is moved from core.py to the main file, to ensure consistency with previous usage of root_check in the code used earlier.

Here are the specific code changes made:

In auto_cpufreq/core.py:
- Line 96: Removed the root_check call from the set_override function. This was intended to be done to comply with code template, i.e. to use root_check in the main file.

In bin/auto-cpufreq:
- Line 45: Added a root_check call before calling set_override in main program. Also, set_override is only called if force option is invoked, saving us from precious extra overheads.

Fixes #530</p>

I saw your and @niksingh710 conversation in #530 just didn't get a chance to add anything in the discussion. Also, just as a reminder if you're interested I'm still [looking for contributors to this project](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/discussions/312) :)

I think this problem was plaguing other PR's like @shadeyg56 #486 and other PR's which I just never got to look into, so thank you for your contribution and you'll be credited for your work as part of [upcoming release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

I'm definitely interested. However, my exams are approaching, so I won't be able to contribute for a week or two. But I would love to be a part of this project later on. 

While my knowledge of applied stacks is somewhat limited at the moment, but I believe this opportunity will provide me ample chances to learn and enhance it in general. Having taken my initial steps into the open-source community, I am filled with excitement. I can't wait to dive deeper and contribute to this project! :smiley:
