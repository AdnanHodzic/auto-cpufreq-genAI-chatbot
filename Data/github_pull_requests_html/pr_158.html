                    <p>Unfortunately while this might've fixed problems on desktops. With these changes my laptop (Lenovo X1 Carbon) is constantly reporting that `Battery is: charging` whether this is true or not. 

There are couple of ways you could do this, you first want to make check if you're on laptop or desktop. Easiest way to do this is by running: `hostnamectl status | grep Chassis | cut -f2 -d ":" | tr -d ' '`

If laptop it'll return `laptop` otherwise it should be `desktop`.

Alternatively, see what's done as part of ["charging" function](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/blob/master/auto_cpufreq/core.py#L114) and potentially utilize what's being done in `ac_state` or `battery_info` to make similiar kind of check. </p>
