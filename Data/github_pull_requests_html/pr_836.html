                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>To preserve battery life when [auto-cpufreq daemon (`--install`)](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/bluetooth#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon) is installed, Bluetooth will be disabled by default at boot. Bluetooth can be enabled at any time later on.

Regardless, over the time, a feature requests and bugs were reported over this which this PR is aiming to close:

* [Feature] Bluetooth disabled after reboot #673
* [Feature request ] How can I stop disabling of bluetooth on boot? #451
* deploy_daemon() disables Bluetooth regardless of using laptop on AC #92

This PR brings 2 new flags which are also described on [auto-cpufreq README page.](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq)

*  [`--bluetooth_boot_off`  Turn off Bluetooth on boot](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/bluetooth#bluetooth_boot_off)
* [ `--bluetooth_boot_on`   Turn on Bluetooth on boot](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/bluetooth#bluetooth_boot_on)

Now, for those who don't even have auto-cpufreq daemon installed and/or are only using it for [monitoring](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/bluetooth#monitor) or [live](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/tree/bluetooth#live). Or if you're simply trying to find a quick way to prevents GNOME from automatically enabling Bluetooth on every reboot or after suspend/wake up even if you manually disable it. 

You can turn off bluetooth at boot by running: `sudo auto-cpufreq --bluetooth_boot_off`

Or, if you installed auto-cpufreq daemon but would like to keep bluetooth enabled at boot can also do so by running `auto-cpufreq --bluetooth_boot_on`
