            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I've included last @Red-Eyed code suggestion, and also included an optimization for detect correct load when there are more than 8 CPUS (now based on percentage).

I've checked the results with geekbench with charging state and battery. Turbo gets enabled and disabled fast (some times when the system get very high load takes a bit to get disabled).

Based on geekbench results, I'm getting very good results: https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/search?page=1&q=3700u&utf8=%E2%9C%93

Please take a look, maybe some parameters could be improved a bit, but for me works really well.</p>
