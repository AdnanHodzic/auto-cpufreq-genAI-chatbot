                    <p>I would appreciate if PR description would have a brief (even single sentence is good) description of what a PR does.

Regarding following sentences:

> set by the manufacturer
& 
> value set in the system by the manufacturer.

Is there a way user can see to what values are set by the manufacturer, if yes I think it would be good idea to add that info.

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I see nothing wrong with this PR. Since I don't have a laptop from Lenovo with this I can't test. @Genius-19 Thanks for your PR your guide should help many.</p>

                    <p>I've tested for a week on my lenovo ideapad including all the classic tests (plug, unplug, reboot, change values, etc).
Thank you all for this amazing software</p>
