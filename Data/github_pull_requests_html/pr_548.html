                <p>This resolves #545.

Not sure how I didn't notice this before, as I was experiencing the same on my laptop.

I believe AMD drivers on Linux do not report individual core temps, so the `coretemp` sensor was not found and it was defaulting to the first sensor it could find which was my SSD temperature.
I added 2 additional sensors to check for. My temp is reported by ACPI, and then k10temp reports the Tctl which is used as a last resort. Now, if it can't find a sensor it will return "nan".</p>
