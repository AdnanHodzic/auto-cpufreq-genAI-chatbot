            <p><strong>Pull Request #702</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>* Removed the `else` from the top level of the charging() function, the logic is the same but slightly easier to read now.

* Use `if not x.exists()` in the charging() function before opening the file instead of FileNotFoundError exceptions, makes the function a lot easier to read.

* Close the power_supply_type_path after reading the supply_type as it is not used later.

* Remove `else: continue` from the end of the charging() function for loop, this didn't actually do anything.

I tested the charging() function on my laptop plugged in and plugged out and it is still working as expected with these changes.</p>
