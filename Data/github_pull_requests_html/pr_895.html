                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Prior, there was no way for users encountering incorrect battery detection via `get_battery_path()` had no option to manually set the desired battery. On my Minisforum V3 tablet I have 3 devices listed in `/sys/class/power_supply/`. The battery detection was selecting the device that resulted in the battery status never changing, and the percentage to always show as 0%. These changes allow the user to specify, via the config, a device from `/sys/class/power_supply` they wish to have auto-cpufreq use. This is done by:

1. Adding `battery_device = {some batt}` as a valid setting in the config file
2. Adding an if statement to `get_battery_path()` to check for the config value above and return the user set device's path if it is a valid device</p>
