                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This provides a workaround to allow installation of on Fedora Atomic and similar systems where installing GUI dependencies (specifically PyGObject and related packages) is problematic.

This PR creates a separate `pyproject.toml` file to remove all dependencies and build instructions related to the GUI component. This allows the core functionality of `auto-cpufreq` to be installed without requiring the GUI.
