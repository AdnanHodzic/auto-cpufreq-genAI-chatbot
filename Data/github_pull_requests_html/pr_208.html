                <p>Output from manual testing _(with an `exit 99` a few lines down after
this patch, so the script wouldn't actually continue for my testing -
see exit codes included in my $PS1)_

                    <p>LGTM, can you just rephrase following part to:

```
echo -e "WARNING: this installer is temporarily NOT recommended\n" >&2
echo -e "Instead please use our Snap package:" >&2
echo -e "https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#snap-store\n"
echo -e "or AUR if you're using Arch/Manjaro or any of its derivatives\n"
echo -e "https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#aur-package-archmanjaro-linux\n"
echo -e "For more context, see: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/196" >&2
```

Think it's good to point to direct links and will give better text formatting.</p>

                    <p>@jzacsh I'm sorry these changes never went live, but this has now been permanently resoled as part of auto-cpufreq running in a python virtual env. Changes live as part of [v1.9.0 release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).

Regardless, thank you for your contribution! </p>
