                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Fixed some formatting for the installer and lessened the number of echo calls with here docs, etc.

Now, seperators are done properly, to the width of the terminal and are proper box dashes (as per the Unicode specification):

Adjusting the size adjusts the bar:

                    <p>Very nice, I actually wanted to do this myself but never got around it. Two things:

1. Adjusting the size of terminal will result in breaking the lines, i.e:
![This is an image](http://foolcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/auto-cpufreq-new-sep.png)

As from what I understood this doesn't happen for you? If I re-run the same command on new re-sized terminal width then line will be adjusted.

2. Why is this only done for `install`, as for example `remove` will not use any of this new functionality. I.e
```
------------------------- auto-cpufreq daemon removed -------------------------
```

But I guess it's related to what I proposed in 4 as this stuff is used outside of installer

3. Let's ident "For list of options, run:" to the left, as now it looks bit off:

```
auto-cpufreq tool successfully installed.

  		For list of options, run:
auto-cpufreq --help
```


5. After we merge this, it would be great if you could make these same changes across auto-cpufreq output where `sep` and `seperator` are being used.

Well, lines that are already drawn will not resize, but yes, running the command again in a resized terminal will adjust to the size.

I uh... didn't see that. I'll make some commits and fix those, they will probably use the same logic as the install heading :smile:

Will do

The only problem with that is that I don't know python very well.... I usually program in c and make small shell scripts. It shouldn't be too hard though. I'll keep you informed if I cannot do it</p>

                    <p>If it helps, there's even a snippet that will take care of terminal sizing/padding but was never merged with `master` branch, reference: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/pull/325#issuecomment-999486895</p>

                    <p>I'll probably make a new branch and PR to merge anything outside the installer.

I took the liberty to replace Hyphens in the headers to an "equals to" sign (`=`):

Let me know if you prefer one over the other, and if there are any other problems :dagger:

Definitely a good idea, since there will be lot more changes and it'll be a lot bigger PR.

Let's please return these to `---`, I find the output to be "too bulky" with `===`. Ideally these would be lines as they are for `seperator` and could also scale. See if you could make it like that, as that would be excellent.

Also let's add an empty line before "Welcome to ..."

Most welcome, I'm honored to make your first PR a pleasant experience and too many more! :beers:

Done

They also dynamically size just like the seperator:

                    <p>I've just noticed a regression introduced as part of #460, so let's resolve this first before this PR is merged.</p>

                    <p>I was about to merge these changes, but then I found out what was missing as part of #462, I won't revert the changes so maybe it's easiest to make the changes as part of this PR?

Currently, if you do `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install` and do not run `sudo auto-cpufreq --install` in meantime, but go straight to `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove` you'll end up getting the following error:

```
Couldn't remove the auto-cpufreq daemon
/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove or /usr/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove do not exist.
```</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>abvee:</strong></p>
                    <p>> so maybe it's easiest to make the changes as part of this PR?

Okay, will do.

Okay, I'll keep the error, but remove the other files....</p>

                    <p>the `auto-cpufreq --remove` command already prints an error, so I'm not going to reprint it.

I also added a check for the  wrapper script, so it should just work now</p>
