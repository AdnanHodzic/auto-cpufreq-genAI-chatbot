                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Tried addressing #115  and #114 (since getting the table data required modifying the same code).
Please corroborate correct reporting of cpu temps, I can only test with my lap cpu.
Btw, is the try/exec block really needed? Are there cases where psutil.sensor_temperatures() reports a shwtemp object without the _current_ property?</p>

Yes, it works and looks great on Intel i7. @Red-Eyed can you confirm same case is with AMD?

TBH, I can't remember why this `try/except` block is there, but there must be a reason. If you think there's a better way to go about this, please feel free to address it in another PR :)

Thank you for your contribution!
