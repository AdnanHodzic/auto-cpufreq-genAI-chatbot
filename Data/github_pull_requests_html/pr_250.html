            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This branch adds support for a configuration file to allow users to set preferred governors and turbo boost behavior for when connected a power source and when running on battery.

In the case of my devices powersave is not necessarily the best cpu governor when on battery.</p>

                    <p>Hi @zoitrok this looks great and is a long/high requested feature! #26 

I have few suggestions and remarks before we get this merged. 

**README**

As part of this PR I would also like to have README updated, in particular to have a new "Configuration/Settings file" section which elaborates on how a config file can be used. As currently if you don't know how to read Python you won't be able to figure out how to use it :)

**Explicitly state that conf file is used**

Although in auto-cpufreq output it's stated when conf file is used, I would be even more explicit.

When auto-cpufreq is first started "Note: You can quit live mode by pressing "ctrl+c"" message is printed. It would be good idea if right below that line something like: "Using settings defined in /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf file" is stated, just for additional clarity.

**Changes to .conf file**

Then as part of auto-cpufreq.conf file:

```
# preferred governor
governor = performance
```

Maybe it would be a good idea as part of `# preferred governor` to also have a comment how to get a list of available governors, i.e: `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors`

Or what would be an ideal is to extend `auto-cpufreq --debug` so it can also show list of available governors, and then user could refer and see what they could select. 

It also might not be a bad idea to point to new contributors who are interested on how they could extend auto-cpufreq.conf file with their field of interest, but this is optional as they should be able to look at code and figure how it works.

**Snap doesn't see /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf**

Finally, if auto-cpufreq is installed using a snap package (which is running in a containerized env) it won't know about `/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf` on local file system. So I think being able to specify any location where the file is located using new `--config` argument would be a better idea and then even "snap/containerized" version of auto-cpufreq would be able to use it?

Either way, thank you again and looking forward to your update and/or comments!

                    <p>Hi @AdnanHodzic and thanks for the constructive and detailed review!

I think I've addressed most concerns.

- The README file now has a section about configuration
- Live mode explicitly says that settings from a configuration file is used, and where it is located
- The sample configuration file has comments about where to find available governors. The debug option to list available ones sounds like a good feature, but I think it could be out of the scope for this PR. I don't mind adding it later.
- I've also added a --config parameter to explicitly give a path to a config file located elsewhere. Defaulting to /etc/auto-cpufreq.conf if none is provided.</p>

                    <p>Hey @zoitrok, first of all I apologize for delayed response. Changes you made are superb and have definitely addressed all of my remarks/concerns.

I'll make a 1.7.0 release today and make sure to credit you in [releases page](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases). Looking forward to any new PR's you may come up with in future! </p>
