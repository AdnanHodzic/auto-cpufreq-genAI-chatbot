                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>systemd 220(released in 2015) [supports the "--now" switch.](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/e37701a8cd2db1e67d28bcf337467d8efc6de41e/NEWS#L13992-L13995)

When this switch is present, the units that are enabled will also be started, and the ones disabled also stopped.

This is a good opportunity to remove some unnecessary lines of code and improve code readability.
We can start and stop services with just one single command:
~~~
systemctl enable/disable --now <service-name>
~~~

Also, systemctl daemon-reload is not really necessary when disabling/enabling a service.

Let me know if you notice any unintended side effects or if you have any feedback in general!
