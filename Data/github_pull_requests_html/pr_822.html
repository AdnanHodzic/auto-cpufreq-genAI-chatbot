            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
Changed python version requirement to >=3.9 to fix error: 

> pygobject requires Python <4.0,>=3.9, so it will not be satisfied for Python >=3.8,<3.9

Changed PyGObject to an optional dependency. 

Changes to be committed:
	modified:   poetry.lock
	modified:   pyproject.toml
-----------

After making this change, I was able to install the program with poetry, and install onto Silverblue 41 successfully. 
I tried to check if this fixes #574, but ran into an issue with Gnome Boxes not being able to access a governor. I will continue to mess with that and report back here if I get any success. </p>

                    <p>LGTM! Thank you for your contribution, you will be credited for your work as part of [future release](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases).Â 

Closes #601 

Besides #601, does this mean #677 could also be closed? Since you said you'll look into #574 as it's also related. 

@shadeyg56 fyi,this merge broke the nix build.</p>

                    <p>#574 
------
I was able to get auto-cpufreq to build and install on a Kubuntu VM, but not able to get cpu governor pass-through to work inside it; so I was only able to build and install but not actually install/enable the daemon. I suspect its in a similar state to silverblue

#677 / Silverblue
-----
PyGobject is failing because PyCairo is failing, because silverblue doesn't ship with clang/gcc, causing 601. Making PyGobject optional & adding pyasyncore as a dependency let me install the daemon, but auto-cpufreq-gtk crashes because it can't import PyGobject.

In a Toolbox where the installer can `dnf install gcc`, everything works as expected, except the container doesn't have permission to use systemctl. Outside the toolbox, the installer can't `dnf install gcc`. It's definitely a silverblue issue and the fix will probably end up being specific installation instructions.


How much does any of this relate to #677? I looked into his .spec/repo and it looked like gcc was included so I don't think much.
Considering the user is trying to build an RPM to install on a fork of Universal Blue, which is itself a fork of silverblue, its hard to say, and I'm not sure how to check.

That would've been an easy thing to have done myself :sweat_smile:

I will continue trying to get -gtk working on silverblue, and submit a PR to update the readme if I can get it figured out.

                    <p>Ok sounds good, in that case let's just leave those other issues open for now.
