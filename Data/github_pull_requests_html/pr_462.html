            <h1>Fix for Regression in #460</h1>
            <p><strong>Pull Request #462</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The uninstall script was checking old locations (`/usr/bin/<file>`) that were changed by @gimbles

When the check to see if `/usr/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove` existed failed (since it's now at `/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove`), the removal didn't occur fully and the installer silently goes on until the  success message is wrongly printed.

Just adding  a check for this should make it work now

However, people who downloaded older versions of `auto-cpufreq` will still have those scripts at the old locations (in `/usr/bin`), so I added some variables with an `_old` suffix so people cloning a new repo and running the script can still uninstall their old versions of `auto-cpufreq`.

We could also use `/usr/local/bin` for only Silverblue, which is something I can work on later, but this should fix the script for now.</p>

Great thinking!

Yea, for now it's fine and I don't mind keeping it under `/usr/local/bin`, as it would be good to have paths as unified as possible.

Regarding your commit, you have a syntax error, please change line 192 to from:

```
  if [ -f $srv_remove -o -f $srv_remove_old]; then
```

to:

```
  if [ -f $srv_remove -o -f $srv_remove_old ]; then
```

I also get following error when I try to remove (older then this PR) auto-cpufreq installed from current `master` branch:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Couldn't remove the auto-cpufreq daemon
/usr/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove or /usr/bin/auto-cpufreq-remove do not exist.
```

and I'll run into some issue as part of your branch `abvee-460-regression` (even if prior to `--remove` I do `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove`) whether auto-cpufreq daemon is installed or not ...</p>

My bad, I'll fix it

Like the idiot I am, I forgot to add `local` to the path. I just tested it, it should work now</p>
