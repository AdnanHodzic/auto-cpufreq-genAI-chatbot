                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This allows building with both psutil 6.x and 7.x. Closes #817.

Upstream [1] released psutil 7.0.0 recently, which caused a build failure on nixpkgs ci [2].
Checking release notes [3], `memory_info_ex` was removed (unused in auto-cpufreq),
and minimum python version requirements were increased to what this project uses already anyways.
