                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>psutil method `sensors_battery().power_plugged` doesn't always give accurate information of power source. I think it takes into account the charging the battery status. If battery is 100%, this method returns `None` for me. But with the `power` utility, the measuring of the AC-battery status is more accurate.</p>
