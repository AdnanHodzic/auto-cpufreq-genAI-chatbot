                    <p>@gimbles while reviewing #459 I noticed a particular regression introduced with this PR. 

Namely, prior to these changes if you perform an install auto-cpufreq with `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install` followed by installation of daemon `sudo auto-cpufreq --install`, then you decide to remove everything with `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove` you'll get following output:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove 

--------------------- Removing auto-cpufreq daemon ----------------------

* Turn on bluetooth on boot

----------------------------------- Warning -----------------------------------

Detected GNOME Power Profiles daemon service is stopped!
This service will now be enabled and started again.

* Enabling GNOME power profiles
Removed "/etc/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service".
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/graphical.target.wants/power-profiles-daemon.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/power-profiles-daemon.service.

------------------ Running auto-cpufreq daemon removal script ------------------

* Stopping auto-cpufreq daemon (systemd) service

* Disabling auto-cpufreq daemon (systemd) at boot

* Removing auto-cpufreq daemon (systemd) unit file

* Reloading systemd manager configuration
reset failed

------------------------- auto-cpufreq daemon removed -------------------------

auto-cpufreq successfully removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

auto-cpufreq tool and all its supporting files successfully removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

However, after these changes have been merged if you do the same steps as mentioned above, you'll only be presented with:

```
sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

auto-cpufreq tool and all its supporting files successfully removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I'd really like if same more verbose removal output was brought back as it gives more clarity to user on what happened. Can you please create a new PR for this? Thank you</p>

@gimbles I know, I'm also baffled myself. But have tracked it down where d77c1de commit (one before these changes were merged) doesn't have this behavior. 

@SunkenHero can you confirm if you have this problem as well?</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>abvee:</strong></p>
                    <p>The installer script just evaluates and runs `/usr/local/bin/auto-cpufreq --remove` when it tests that `auto-cpufreq-remove` exists. 

If this test fails, then it's likely that nothing is removed and the function silently goes on to print `auto-cpufreq tool and all its supporting files successfully removed.` 

This would also explain the lack of messages.

We should add a check in the installer to see if the test is successful or not, which would also help in debugging this particular issue. So something like this:

```
  if [ -f $srv_remove ]; then
    eval $tool_proc_rm
  else
  	separator
	printf "Failed to uninstall"
	separator
	return 1;
  fi
```</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">

@abvee please give it a try and needless to say create a PR if you're successful :)

I have some code, but I'm a bit lost on what to do with it. It's my first time actually contributing to a repository, so I'm not sure what best practice here is..... do I make a fork of @gimbles repository or just a new branch and PR on my own fork that includes my installer changes ?</p>

                    <p>@abvee you would create a PR from auto-cpufreq `master` branch. Changes made in this PR by @gimbles have already been merged.</p>

But what about the changes I have made to the installer in #459 that have not been merged yet ? Do I modify the original install script and let you do the merging ? Sorry for all the unrelated questions, couldn't find any proper answers on google :(</p>

Don't worry about it, I'll merge it as soon as this regression has been fixed. Reason why I didn't merge it yet is I'm trying to reduce entropy around this issue. </p>
