                <p>Turbo should be enabled when one thread reach 100% of usage, in original version there was a fixed value of 25%, but this only works when there're 4 threads, in CPUs with more threads

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic I checked this PR:
I just loaded my single core on 100% by command: `python -c "while True: pass"` and it switches to turbo</p>

                    <p>@Red-Eyed how many threads can handle your CPU? is your laptop in charging state? If there are only 4 is normal, but if the CPU can handle more than 4 CPUs is normal that the CPU load doesn't reach 25% (at least on an AMD Ryzen 3700U, because I haven't tested with an Intel CPU).

In new portable AMD CPUs with more than 4C/8T, with an only 25% usage the problem will more noticeable.</p>

                    <p>Hello @Red-Eyed :) ,

Not sure if because the CPU model, but in my case it didn't launch turbo. I used the stress tool for generate a 100% load:

 sudo stress --cpu 1 --timeout 120                
</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>Just tried `sudo stress --cpu 1 --timeout 20` and it works like a charm: 20 secs with `turbo boost: on` than it switched to `turbo boost: off`
I have CPU: ` AMD Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx`</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>BTW, are you able to switch to turbo anyway?</p>

                    <p>@Red-Eyed with my modified version works fine, with original version the turbo doesn't get activated unless I use two threads, for example:
 sudo stress --cpu 2 --timeout 20</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>Red-Eyed:</strong></p>
                    <p>@AdnanHodzic it seems that this PR should use this `psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)`
`psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)` will return list with cpu load per core</p>

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic 
I think that this code example should work correct:
```python
if psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=False) >= 25.0 or isclose(max(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)), 100):
    turbo(True)
```
My apologise, @rrodriguez81 this is your PR. Try the above code snippet 
before using `isclose`
you need to add
`from math import isclose`</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>I can also confirm it works as expected on Intel. I.e `sudo stress --cpu 1 --timeout 15` works like a charm on i7-8565U.

Are you saying to replace (current) i.e:

```
cpuload > 100 / CPUS
```
with:

```
psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=False) >= 25.0
```

and same result will be achieved?

                    <p>> @AdnanHodzic actually, could you please remind me at what conditions turbo should be enabled?

Before this PR (and I think those values were good and we should keep them):

power-save/battery:

```
load1m > CPUS / 7
cpuload > 25
```

performance:

```
load1m >= CPUS / 5
cpuload > 20
```

And I quite like what @rrodriguez81 did, as it's very simple yet powerful solution. But I'm also interested in outcome of:

```
if psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=False) >= 25.0 or isclose(max(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)), 100):
    turbo(True)
```

I'm thinking that maybe we should make turbo more "trigger happy" when in performance mode, i.e:

```
load1m >= CPUS / 4
cpuload > 15
```

Although this might be too aggressive.

@AdnanHodzic regarding your idea about performance mode, if you set a static value, could be difficult to trigger turbo with CPUs with more than 8 threads.

For example: For 8 threads CPUS: 100 / 8 = the turbo is triggered with 12.5 CPU load, but if there is a Ryzen 4800H, with 8 cores and 16 threads, 100 / 16 , 100%  CPU usage of one thread is 6,25% total of total CPU load.

Agreed, having it hard coded is terrible. If it's fine with you @rrodriguez81 let's go with @Red-Eyed eye proposal as it's very clear what's happening. But since this your PR I'd like you to commit these changes, let's just figure out this first:

                    <p>@AdnanHodzic @Red-Eyed not sure why, but with 100 / CPUS the turbo get triggered faster than with @Red-Eyed ' s provided solution.

With my solution the turbo is triggered instantly, and with @Red-Eyed sometimes takes a few seconds (3 or 4 seconds not too much). Maybe because the isclose()  is an approximation or only needs an higher value.

But I'm agree using @Red-Eyed if is more clear for the code.

Maybe `psutil` takes such a delay
regarding `isclose` it's just approximation as you [cannot strongly compare floats](https://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/)
instead of `isclose`, u can try
```python
if psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=False) >= 25.0 or max(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True)) > 99:
    turbo(True)
```</p>

                    <p>@Red-Eyed the same problem, it trigger turbo slower than the 100 / CPUS solution. It takes to me a few seconds aswell.

Also seems fine on Intel. 

> so it seems that `psutil` takes some average that requires some time

This is also fine as I also want to switch so snap using latest Python and Ubuntu 20.04 as base in near future which might also fix things + one of the future psutil lib updates might also address this.

Either way, thank you both and especially to @rrodriguez81 for your first contribution :partying_face: </p>
