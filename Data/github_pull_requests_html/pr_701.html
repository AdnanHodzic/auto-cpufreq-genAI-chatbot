                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I noticed when messing with my Nix config, that there were 2 versions of `auto-cpufreq` being installed, which didn't seem right. Took a look at our Nix module, and noticed it was pulling in the outdated version of `auto-cpufreq` from the `nixpkgs` repo alongside the git version

This is just a simple fix to stop it from pulling the unnecessary package and dependencies </p>
