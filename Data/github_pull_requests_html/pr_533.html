                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When you give "nosmt" to your kernel, you still get directories under /sys that correspond to inactive hyperthreads, but there's nothing writable inside those directories, which causes auto-cpufreq to generate lots of logspam.</p>

                    <p>> you will be credited for your work

I would rather not be, if it's all the same to you, having taken a closer look at the sources.

Oh man.   Many, many possible reasons.  Where to even begin.

(I apologize if this comment sounds hostile.  I do not mean it to!  At this point I choose to believe that this whole project is an art performance, meant to show what's wrong with Linux user-space ecosystem in general and also how not to write software.  Right?)</p>

Noted, you will not be credited.

Not sure what you mean by this.

Thanks for the heads up, because what follows definitely made it one of the most hostile and ill mannered comments :)

Needless to say, hours and hours of various contributors work, 4k stars on Github, 61 contributors, various mentions in reputable sites and news paper definitely don't agree with this statement. 

If you think something is wrong, feel free to improve & fix it. Otherwise you're also free to stay away from this project.</p>
