                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Hi, I managed to create a VM and install opensuse leap, so I made this changes to install auto-cpufreq without errors:
* Adds detection of openSUSE Leap by using a regexp when checking for the distribution ID.
* Adds `python3-devel` and `gcc` packages to be installed with zypper, as a new OS Leap install does not include them, they are also added to tumbleweed to be sure they are present (and for symmetry, too).
* Changes the bash comment to include both Tumbleweed and Leap version of openSUSE.</p>
