            <h1>Add load from user config in XDG_CONFIG_HOME if available</h1>
            <p><strong>Pull Request #672</strong></p>
            <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This update introduces the flexibility to load the configuration file from multiple locations, prioritizing user preferences and system standards. Previously, the configuration was strictly read from a hardcoded system path (`/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf`). Now, the application first checks if the user has specified a configuration file path via command line arguments. If not, it looks for a configuration file in the user's config directory (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/auto-cpufreq/auto-cpufreq.conf`). If neither is found, it defaults to the original system-wide configuration file.

This allows users to add their auto-cpufreq configuration to their dotfiles.

In addition, since providing a config file path via `--config` is now an explicit choice, an error is raised if this path is not a valid file.

### Old behavior
```sh
auto-cpufreq --stats # Looks for config in "/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf"
auto-cpufreq --config <CONFIG> --stats # Looks for config in <CONFIG>
auto-cpufreq --config <INVALID_PATH> --stats  # No error/warning
```

### New behavior
```sh
auto-cpufreq --stats # Looks for config in (A) "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/auto-cpufreq/auto-cpufreq.conf" then (B) "/etc/auto-cpufreq.conf"
auto-cpufreq --config <CONFIG> --stats # Looks for config in <CONFIG>
auto-cpufreq --config <INVALID_PATH> --stats  # Error
```

                    <p>> It might be best to merge this PR to a different branch and then I can handle the merge myself.

@shadeyg56, yes let's do this. As I said in PM, I'm out traveling for work for next 2 weeks and don't have my personal laptop with me to test/look into this properly. 

Hence please feel free to merge it if it makes sense to you.</p>

                    <p>Looks good! I'm merging this into the `config-conflict` branch and I will merge these changes into #663 so that all of it can be merged into `master` at the same time.
