                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>When install from git using the `auto-cpufreq-installer` I noticed the follow error on a Debian based distro:
```
The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.
 
    apt install python3.8-venv
```

Added that package to the debian based installer packages.

                    <p>Excellent catch! `python3-venv` is the dummy package that should be installed, but I see you set that so :+1: </p>
