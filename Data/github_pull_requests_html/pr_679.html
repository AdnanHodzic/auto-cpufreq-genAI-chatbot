                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>this PR added warning messages. #675 suggested this change. instead of try and except this replaces it with `os.path.exists` and `os.path.isfile` checks  </p>

                    <p>Good idea, but the issue is these messages will only be printed once in `auto-cpufreq --stats`, which makes them pretty useless and unlikely to be seen by the user

There needs to be something that is called every time the daemon refreshes. A potential solution I can think of would be to save any messages thrown by the battery scripts during setup and just append those to the stats on every daemon refresh</p>

                    <p>I think for the mean time this will work it will give warnings with --live --monitor --status Mabye in a future PR we can add these other functions</p>

                    <p>Great start and definitely needed, but we can make this PR better :) 

Logging is definitely a much needed feature, work was started on this long time ago as part of #182 but unfortunately was never completed. 

Hence, until we don't have that. What I would propose is to output both:

```
number of batteries = X
batteryX start threshold is set to 0
batteryX stop threshold is set to 100
```

lines as part of live, monitoring (already there, just let's format them to be as above with line breaks separating it from rest of the output) and also include this as part of `--stats` & `--debug`.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>PurpleWazard:</strong></p>
                    <p>ive reformatted the output of the battery information how does this look?

-------------------------------- Battery Info ---------------------------------

battery count = 2

battery0 start threshold = 80

battery0 stop threshold = 90

battery1 start threshold = 80

battery1 stop threshold = 90
</p>
                </div>
            
                <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <p><strong>AdnanHodzic:</strong></p>
                    <p>> battery count = 2
> 
> battery0 start threshold = 80
> 
> battery0 stop threshold = 90
>

> 
> battery1 stop threshold = 90

Looks good, but I would remove the empty lines between these, i.e:

```
-------------------------------- Battery Info ---------------------------------

battery count = 2
battery0 start threshold = 80
battery0 stop threshold = 90
battery1 start threshold = 80
battery1 stop threshold = 90
```</p>

                    <p>unfortunately i cant remove the blank lines for some reason in python when you read a file it prints a blank line. ive tried other ways but it didnt work.</p>

Just add `end=""` at the end of statement, i.e: `print(f'battery{b} start threshold = {f.read()}', end="")` and that should do the  trick.</p>

@PurpleWazard I didn't see it, did you add these changes? Thinking of making a release in few days so want to merge all PR that will be part of it.</p>

                    <p>No worries and thanks! Unfortunately after install `--stats` fails due to following error:

```
sudo auto-cpufreq --stats                    

Note: You can quit stats mode by pressing "ctrl+c"
