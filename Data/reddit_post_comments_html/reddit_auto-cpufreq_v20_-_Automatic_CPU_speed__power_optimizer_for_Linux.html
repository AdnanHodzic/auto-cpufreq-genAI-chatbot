But easiest thing you can do is, start using auto-cpufreq (install daemon) and you should see how much additional battery time you&#39;re getting. For me it adds about 2 additional hours, but your mileage might very. </p>

<p>If you want to test this theory, override the governor to &quot;performance&quot; (default Linux behavior) and see how much battery life you&#39;ll get. Then override it to &quot;powersave&quot; and see how much you would get then.</p>

<p>What, auto-cpufreq does is switch between these automatically (including turning turbo boost_off &amp; on) based on various criteria. I talk more about this in initial release video, take a look if you&#39;re interested: <a href="https://youtu.be/QkYRpVEEIlg?si=jl4GUli1-2w3sof3&amp;t=40">https://youtu.be/QkYRpVEEIlg?si=jl4GUli1-2w3sof3&amp;t=40</a></p>

<p>Maybe because it&#39;s not easy for some developers of these big companies to accept that some individual/s are doing a better job in this dept then some of their teams. So instead of joining forces they are trying to make their own solution the same problem.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s because speed optimization &amp; power effeciency isn&#39;t high enough on their list of priorities. </p>

<p>I’ve had no issues like that with autocpu-freq, it works seemlessly. And the battery life improvement increase is much better with autocpu-freq.</p>

<p>You can call autocpu-freq anytime from the command line (with the daemon I think) and check exactly what is going on, and there are a bunch of options to change functionality, but I’ve never bothered with them because it already works so well.</p>

<p>Do I understand correctly that the tool is therefore basically only useful if you have a computer with a battery?</p>

<p>Because when I start the tool on my normal computer, I get the following message, among others.</p>

<pre><code>---------------------------- CPU frequency scaling ----------------------------

Battery is: charging

Setting to use: &quot;performance&quot; governor

Total CPU usage: 0.3

Total system load: 0.46

Average temp. of all cores: 31.00 °C 

Load optimal (load average: 0.46, 0.47, 0.45)

setting turbo boost: off
</code></pre>

<p>With a normal computer without a battery, the state of charge of the (non-existent) battery does not change and therefore presumably the governor does not change either.</p>

<p>Device: Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14IAU7 with an intel 1255U with integrated graphics.</p>

<p>OS: Fedora 39, Gnome 45</p>

<p>auto-cpufreq version (when used): 2.1.0</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Monitor brightness 35%, WiFi on, BT off</p>

<p>intel_pstate + power-profile-daemon = idles at 5.3 W</p>

<p>intel_pstate + auto-cpufreq = idles at 4.7 W</p>

<p>acpi-cpufreq + auto-cpufreq = idles at 5.7 W</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Monitor brightess at 1%, WiFi on, BT off</p>

<p>intel_pstate + auto-cpufreq = idles at 4.0 W</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think the battery goes down slower with auto-cpufreq compared to how it did with power-profile-daemon. This may be due to turbo boost being off when not needed and maybe due to lower max frequencies (not sure if power-profile-deamon changes the frequency cap). The fact that turbo boost is off causes a 1-2 second delay when opening an application, which is expected and probably okay when considering the possible battery life gain.</p>

<p>Not sure, since I don&#39;t know details on what&#39;s the difference between those two, I guess in short `intel_pstate` is just a better driver.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting because for some folks `acpi-cpufreq` works better (see it reported in issues from time to time) as also mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting">auto-cpufreq Troubleshooting section</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to test this theory, override the governor to &quot;performance&quot; (default Linux behavior) and see how much battery life you&#39;ll get. Then override it to &quot;powersave&quot; and see how much you would get then.</p>

<p>I’ve had no issues like that with autocpu-freq, it works seemlessly. And the battery life improvement increase is much better with autocpu-freq.</p>

<p>You can call autocpu-freq anytime from the command line (with the daemon I think) and check exactly what is going on, and there are a bunch of options to change functionality, but I’ve never bothered with them because it already works so well.</p>

<p>I’ve had no issues like that with autocpu-freq, it works seemlessly. And the battery life improvement increase is much better with autocpu-freq.</p>

<p>You can call autocpu-freq anytime from the command line (with the daemon I think) and check exactly what is going on, and there are a bunch of options to change functionality, but I’ve never bothered with them because it already works so well.</p>

So it has zero reproducibility, which one would assume seeing as there’s an included nix flake. Also, python is going to be super inefficient when it comes down to a task like this, and it may seem innocuous it’s going to likely not function in a way that actually saves power. When working with tooling like this you need to hit the problem in kernel, because there’s already hooks for system events, etc.</p>

<p>And finally, all measurements should be using eBPF for speed, executable size and for security.</p>
