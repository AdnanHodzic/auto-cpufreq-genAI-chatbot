I was under the impression that using amd-pstate=active or amd-pstate=guided would be preferred instead of acpi-cpufreq</p>

Should I move to auto-cpufreq?</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m biased when I say auto-cpufreq does a better job, but there&#39;s only way to find it, install it and see how it differs in your battery life.</p>
