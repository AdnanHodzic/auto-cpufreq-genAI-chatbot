<p>I’ve been around this community long enough to not let stuff like this get to me. But I do take note, because it’s a perfect example of what’s broken in open source and the Linux world.</p>

<p>Too often, people go out of their way to downvote or discourage someone who&#39;s spending their free time and effort building software to help others and make things better in this world.</p>

<p>It doesn’t make much sense, but hey ... here we are 🙂</p>
