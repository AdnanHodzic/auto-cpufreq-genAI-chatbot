<p>Please note that while auto-cpufreq will make its decision automatically based on various factors, so if it detects you need more performance it will change governor to performance or will enable turbo. If it detects you don&#39;t need performance, it&#39;ll will give you a max battery life.</p>

<p>Besides that, you have numerous configuration options if you would like to configure things yourself, instead of it deciding everything for you automatically. Like forcing a governor, or using a configuration file which allows you to configure numerous things to your own liking:  <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#2---force-governor-override">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#2---force-governor-override</a></p>

<p>`sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --install` will detect which distro you&#39;re using and install everything, after which I would suggest you install auto-cpufreq as a demon: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon</a></p>

<p>If you want to remove everything for some reason, simply run `sudo ./auto-cpufreq-installer --remove` which will remove the daemon and auto-cpufreq itself.</p>

<p>auto-cpufreq sill set hardware limits, e.g: It tells the CPU &quot;Don&#39;t go above 2.0GHz&quot; or &quot;Stay in Powersave mode.&quot;</p>

<p>sched_ext responsibility is task logic e.g: It tells the system &quot;Run this game on the fastest core&quot; or &quot;Give this background task less priority.&quot;</p>

<p>There might be some conflicts, I haven&#39;t tried it myself, suggest to install auto-cpufreq as a daemon and monitor &quot;auto-cpufreq --stats&quot; output to see if some of frequencies are stuck in larticlar range or behaving erradictly.</p>

<p>Keep in my mind while auto-cpufreq makes decisions automatically based on various criteria. It lets you configure it to your own liking as I explained above: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior</a></p>

<p>TL;DR of how auto-cpufreq works is summarized in first paragraph of project ReadMe, where based on various criteria adjust the CPU frequencies, governors, turbo state, etc to extend battery life, or if performance is needed give it to you even if it&#39;s on battery: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#:%7E:text=Automatic%20CPU%20speed%20%26%20power%20optimizer%20for%20Linux.%20Actively%20monitors%20laptop%20battery%20state%2C%20CPU%20usage%2C%20CPU%20temperature%2C%20and%20system%20load%2C%20ultimately%20allowing%20you%20to%20improve%20battery%20life%20without%20making%20any%20compromises">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#:~:text=Automatic%20CPU%20speed%20%26%20power%20optimizer%20for%20Linux.%20Actively%20monitors%20laptop%20battery%20state%2C%20CPU%20usage%2C%20CPU%20temperature%2C%20and%20system%20load%2C%20ultimately%20allowing%20you%20to%20improve%20battery%20life%20without%20making%20any%20compromises</a>.</p>

<p>Please note it can also be configured to your own liking without automated decisions which it thinks are best for you based on above mentioned factors: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file</a></p>

I acquired an Asus Tuf (507nu) last year, but I decided to use NixOS to have the same configuration as on my desktop PC (plus, I love Nix). I tried TLP and wasn&#39;t convinced; for simplicity, I stuck with power-profiles-daemon. But lately, I&#39;ve been completely transforming my configuration, so this new release is a good opportunity for a change. How is Asus&#39; hardware support? And how well does auto-cpufreq work with AsusD (I&#39;ve also been looking into it lately)?</p>

<p>I know they have a Flake for NixOS, so it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to install.</p>

<p>auto-cpufreq-installer (recommended way to install) does support NixOS: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer</a></p>

<p>But NixOS is very well supported as part of auto-cpufreq has its own package/flakes, so you might as well go with that option: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#nixos">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#nixos</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a Asus laptop, but from issues and feedback I got auto-cpufreq works very well with Asus laptops.  </p>

<p>auto-cpufreq and asusd (asusctl) should work great in tandem then replace each other. While auto-cpufreq handles CPU frequency scaling and &quot;race to sleep&quot; power management, asusd is specifically designed to handle Asus-specific hardware like fan curves, keyboard RGB, and dGPU (graphics) switching.</p>

<p>So, give it a try :)</p>

<p>Please note that while auto-cpufreq will make its decision automatically based on various factors, so if it detects you need more performance it will change governor to performance or will enable turbo.

<p>Besides that, you have numerous configuration options if you would like to configure things yourself, instead of it deciding everything for you automatically.

<p>auto-cpufreq sill set hardware limits, e.g: It tells the CPU &quot;Don&#39;t go above 2.0GHz&quot; or &quot;Stay in Powersave mode.&quot;</p>

<p>sched_ext responsibility is task logic e.g: It tells the system &quot;Run this game on the fastest core&quot; or &quot;Give this background task less priority.&quot;</p>

<p>There might be some conflicts, I haven&#39;t tried it myself, suggest to install auto-cpufreq as a daemon and monitor &quot;auto-cpufreq --stats&quot; output to see if some of frequencies are stuck in larticlar range or behaving erradictly.</p>

<p>Keep in my mind while auto-cpufreq makes decisions automatically based on various criteria. It lets you configure it to your own liking as I explained above: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior</a></p>

<p>TL;DR of how auto-cpufreq works is summarized in first paragraph of project ReadMe, where based on various criteria adjust the CPU frequencies, governors, turbo state, etc to extend battery life, or if performance is needed give it to you even if it&#39;s on battery: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#:%7E:text=Automatic%20CPU%20speed%20%26%20power%20optimizer%20for%20Linux.%20Actively%20monitors%20laptop%20battery%20state%2C%20CPU%20usage%2C%20CPU%20temperature%2C%20and%20system%20load%2C%20ultimately%20allowing%20you%20to%20improve%20battery%20life%20without%20making%20any%20compromises">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#:~:text=Automatic%20CPU%20speed%20%26%20power%20optimizer%20for%20Linux.%20Actively%20monitors%20laptop%20battery%20state%2C%20CPU%20usage%2C%20CPU%20temperature%2C%20and%20system%20load%2C%20ultimately%20allowing%20you%20to%20improve%20battery%20life%20without%20making%20any%20compromises</a>.</p>

<p>Please note it can also be configured to your own liking without automated decisions which it thinks are best for you based on above mentioned factors: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#4-auto-cpufreq-config-file</a></p>

<p>Original auto-cpufreq demo and showcase YouTube video, while old and missing a lot of features it has today, still portrays gist of how it works: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg</a></p>

<p>auto-cpufreq-installer (recommended way to install) does support NixOS: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#auto-cpufreq-installer</a></p>

<p>But NixOS is very well supported as part of auto-cpufreq has its own package/flakes, so you might as well go with that option: <a href="https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#nixos">https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#nixos</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a Asus laptop, but from issues and feedback I got auto-cpufreq works very well with Asus laptops.  </p>

<p>auto-cpufreq and asusd (asusctl) should work great in tandem then replace each other. While auto-cpufreq handles CPU frequency scaling and &quot;race to sleep&quot; power management, asusd is specifically designed to handle Asus-specific hardware like fan curves, keyboard RGB, and dGPU (graphics) switching.</p>

<p>So, give it a try :)</p>

<p>auto-cpufreq sill set hardware limits, e.g: It tells the CPU &quot;Don&#39;t go above 2.0GHz&quot; or &quot;Stay in Powersave mode.&quot;</p>

<p>sched_ext responsibility is task logic e.g: It tells the system &quot;Run this game on the fastest core&quot; or &quot;Give this background task less priority.&quot;</p>

<p>There might be some conflicts, I haven&#39;t tried it myself, suggest to install auto-cpufreq as a daemon and monitor &quot;auto-cpufreq --stats&quot; output to see if some of frequencies are stuck in larticlar range or behaving erradictly.</p>

<p>Keep in my mind while auto-cpufreq makes decisions automatically based on various criteria. It lets you configure it to your own liking as I explained above: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/s/YIDpDP2Ior</a></p>
