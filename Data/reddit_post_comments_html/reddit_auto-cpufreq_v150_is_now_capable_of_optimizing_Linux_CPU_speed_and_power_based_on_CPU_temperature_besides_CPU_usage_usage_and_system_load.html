<p>Your issue was that HW decoding wasn&#39;t used. I run my i5 at 1ghz and can still decode just fine. Set up TLP so it lowers clocks on battery, on the GPU too.</p>

<p>Dynamic clocking sounds great to try but I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s really saving all that much battery. Higher clocks at load always pulled more watts and capping them was the solution. The time saved going fast vs using lower clocks longer hasn&#39;t been proved one way or the other from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>
