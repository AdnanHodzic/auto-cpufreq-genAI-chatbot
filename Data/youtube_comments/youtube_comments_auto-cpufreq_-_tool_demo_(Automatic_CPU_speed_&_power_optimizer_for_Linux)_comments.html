<h1>auto-cpufreq - tool demo (Automatic CPU speed & power optimizer for Linux) YouTube video comments</h1>
<ul>
<li>I got a question. Does auto cpufreq conflict if I run a game with gamemoderun that also I assume adjusts CPU freqs. Can I use them together or I need to disable a demon while playing with gamemoderun or maybe gamemoderun isn't even needed?</li>
<ul>
<li>It shouldn't if auto-cpufreq daemon is set to run in "performance" mode while you're gaming. You can configure auto-cpufreq to always run in "performance" mode if it's charging and so on using config file: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file

Similiar issue was mentioned long time ago as part of and some changes were made since then: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/295</li>
<li>@AdnanHodzic  absolutely thank you for breaking it down for me and for the very nice app that is made with love ;)</li>
</ul>
<li>I'm having an issue, I'm using the commands on the Terminal of a Linux Debian(10.13) but it's not seeming to work. It all results on a
sudo: auto-cpufreg: command not found.

Any solution for this issue? Or I'm just fucked up?</li>
<ul>
<li>it's you :) Remember people mentioning this in past: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/495 or just look around yourself: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aall++command+not+found.</li>
</ul>
<li>I'm having a hard time installing the GUI version. I downloaded the source code, installed through terminal, booted it, it hanged, then shut down. Does it have issues with Debian or KDE Neon? It had no issues through Pop OS.

I tried installing Daemon and this is what I get: /opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/python: can't open file '/opt/auto-cpufreq/venv/bin/auto-cpufreq': [Errno 2] No such file or directory</li>

<li>best way to save battery life and linux expirence!</li>
<li>i tested this on an Asus Tuf15 with an nvidia 3050. i gained about 30 minutes, totaling 2.5 hours while playing a youtube video the whole time.

Tested again with just Writer open and a KVM vm running windows 10 (not doing anything). After 2 hours the battery had about 60% left while on "powersave" mode.</li>

<li>Hello sir. Do i just need to install it and I don't have to configure like how I do for tlp?</li>
<ul>
<li>Correct, as it does all of this automatically for you.

But if you do want to configure it you can also do it https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#configuring-auto-cpufreq</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic thanks sir for responding so quickly. I subscribed to your channel now. I had TLP installed and no difference. I have 15 year old Samsung R540 laptop just changed battery and install Linux debian 12. The battery just gives me so little hours. I also notice when i switch laptop off in morning battery is 30% less. I'm installing now via snap your tool. Thanks so much for your contribution</li>
<li>​@@John14vs6_ Most welcome & please consider donating or contributing to the project: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#donate</li>
<li>Should I install powertop if I already have auto-cpufreq?</li>
<li>@@John14vs6_ no need, but up to you.</li>
</ul>
<li>for some reason mine saves
currently using: powersave
suggested using: performance

but never changes off powersave, using --monitor, --live etc

any suggestions?

fedora 39</li>
<li>Is it working even when i close the terminal? or i need to keep my terminal running?</li>
<ul>
<li>I also explained this in v2.0 update video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPGpkZ0AZVU&t=356sI

If you install auto-cpufreq as daemon, then it'll always run in background, as also explained on readme: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#install---auto-cpufreq-daemon</li>
</ul>
<li>I still don't "get" this.  This is what I see, when I have it in "default" checkbox, it's always in performance governor when on the AC brick, the second I unplug the brick and make the laptop go to battery, it flips the governor to powersave.  That's good and all, but is there a way to have it on powersave all the time except if there's a lot of work to do then have it go to performance just until the work is done?
I thought that's what the point of 'ondemand' governor was, why can't we just use that when on AC brick and then set it to powersave when it's on battery?  Maybe ondemand didn't work well?  I finally found a post by Ted T'so way back in 2013 where he said (paraphrased) "the problem with ondemand governor is it doesn't know the capabilities of the particular cpu" but the intel_pstate/amd_pstate govs do.

What I'm after is to get the laptop to be cooler even when on AC brick, I've noticed linux tends to over drive the cpu when it's doing work that doesn't really need full frequency. For example I notice really nice cool cpu temps playing videos when I force the governor to powersave.  The only problem is sometimes I really do want performance gov but only for a short time like uncompressing a big file for a minute or so.

So I think I can  condense what this is doing as:

if on AC then use performance governor
else if on Battery use powersave governor
but you can 'force' it to use either performance or powersave all the time</li>
<ul>
<li>"That's good and all, but is there a way to have it on powersave all the time except if there's a lot of work to do then have it go to performance just until the work is done?"

Yes, that's exactly what auto-cpufreq will do by "default", if it's in powersave, there's a lot of work, it'll switch to performance and turn on turbo boost, once all the heavy work is finished it'll go back to powersave. *But*, if you want to keep it in powersave all the time, you could do this using config file. Set it to be always on powersave and enable "turbo_boost", I explained more in v2.0 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPGpkZ0AZVU&t=608s</li>
</ul>
<li>I did a quick look at the auto-cpufreq-installer, haven't you had lots of people reporting that the tool_install fails on fedora systems?  The tool_install function assumes that redhat based systems have yum but they do not, Fedora has been on dnf alone for quite a while, there is a "yum" wrapper package on recent Fedora's which just points "yum" commands to "dnf-3" (which itself is "dnf") but it's not guaranteed to be installed.  I'll personally just swap "yum" for "dnf" in the one place it needs to be n auto-cpufreq-installer because my systems (Fedora 38 and 39 Beta) don't have the yum wrapper.</li>
<ul>
<li>Please report this as an issue on https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues

Or if you or anyone else wants to give it a try in implementing this functionality, please give it a try and contribute to the project: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution and you will be credited for your work as part of future release https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases</li>

<li>Superb tool - thank you for your work!</li>
<li>this a  great tool thanks for your effort and hard work, as a new linux user and a web dev Enthusiast i'd love to see how you build that if that is possible plz do it</li>
<ul>
<li>thanks! Tool is open source so you can find everything you're interested in on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/</li>
</ul>
<li>thank you^^, i got a 12th gen I5 U intel laptop... and battery life was great in windows until i got my basic things on it... and the battey life went down to 2 hours from 10... so i did what everyone does when windows is disappointing, i went to linux, i'm now using arch and i had somewhat aweful battery life, and thanks to TLP and your tool running with it i'm finally feeling the 'thin-and-ight' laptop experience i was looking for. you're a legend bro.</li>
<li>Freakin' amazing!  Thank you!!!</li>
<li>I was really interested to try it but on my intel i5 5200u doesn't work or it isn't needed. Using the schedutil governor when the load is low my cpu clocks are down to 760 mhz. When the load is high it goes higher. Unfortunately for some reason in powersave mode my cpu gets stuck to 750 mhz (it doesn't go higher if I stress the system) 
So, in my case, auto-cpufreq isn't needed as my cpu is running low anyways under low load.</li>
<li>A little star to your github project  👍 👍</li>
<li>HI!
I am about to switch to ubuntu and would like to ask if it is possible to just disable CPU boost with this software? My processor is ryzen 7 4800h</li>
<li>Nice tool. But is turbo boost option only available for intel?? Its always off on my 5800H (amd)</li>
<ul>
<li>Besides Intel it's available for all major architectures (including amd & arm) as stated in project ReadMe https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#supported-architectures-and-devices

If you have an issue report it on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
</ul>
<li>Thank you for develop this app. I use mxlinux, it uses sysvinit, if i install autocpufreq as a daemon it will work or i have to find another solution?</li>
<li>Tried auto-cpufreq on my ThinkPad T450 running Linux Mint 21.1 and Kernel 5.15, and it just made the i5 5300U processor stay between 500 and 798MHz and fan goes 0rpm. Nothing beyond that on battery, but does go to 2200 MHz on charger and the cpu fan spins. Without auto-cpufreq I get 2700~2900MHz. 
Dunno why it is behaving like that and just results in significantly lost performance compared to the schedutil governor to the point that 720p youtube vids on AVC codec is stuttering hard.
Also tried Kernel 5.19, 6.0, and 6.1 and had the same problem being capped to 798MHz on battery even under load.</li>

<li>Hi Adnan, I've just been playing along with this video, I noticed that when I unplug my power cable, the cpu usage goes up to 25%, but when I replug, it drops to 10%. Have you seen something like this before?</li>
<ul>
<li>interestingly this effect only seems to happen while watching youtube videos.</li>
<li>@as  never seen such a problem, if problem persists, please feel free to report it on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>

<li>How do you abort the monitoring operation?</li>
<ul>
<li>Message is outputted about this right after `auto-cpufreq --monitor" is run:

Note: You can quit monitor mode by pressing "ctrl+c"</li>
</ul>
<li>Great app, was looking for this for weeks! Works great, thank you!</li>
<li>Hey Adnan, I downloaded auto-cp* from your github repo and i want to install it on laptop but as you suggested there, before installing( --install using this option) run systemctl start auto-cpufreq to start the service. So I did it but system respond with {{ Failed to start auto-cpufreq.service: Unit auto-cpufreq.service not found. }}. So now should I install it first using ( --install ) option or what should i do now. Please reply ASAP.</li>
<ul>
<li>I never suggested anything like that. After it's installed refer to: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#how-to-run-auto-cpufreq

If you have an issue please report it on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks for the reply, I have installed it successfully. If anything won't work for me i will report you</li>
</ul>
<li>I'm a beginner, what is the best directory to install it?  I mean directly with his script.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you're a beginner, I'd suggest to install it as a Snap https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#installing-auto-cpufreq

Otherwise if you install it using the auto-cpufreq-installer, directory you clone it to is up to you to chose and will only contain the installer, which you can even remove later on.</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Many Thanks, great job.</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic I was able to install it without problems via installer.  

I have tried both intel_pstate and acpi-cpufreq drivers.  In both cases I cannot go below 800 MHz. 

Is this normal?  The machine is a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th, Intel i7 8550u.</li>
<li>@RickB3n  if you have an issue report it on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
<li>@@RickB3n Yours is the opposite of what I experienced on my ThinkPad T450 where the i5 5300u can't go above 800MHz</li>
</ul>
<li>Does anyone know how to set the mode manually?my thighs are burning away...  
i would like to be always in power saving mode, even when the plug is plugged in.</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic heh i can work with that cool thank you :)</li>
</ul>
<li>Hi! I have a 4600h but when I am in mobility at 100% it does not exceed 1400mhz even if it says "High CPU load, setting turbo boost: on. Can you help me? With the charger I arrive at 3600mhz</li>
<li>Thank you! I run in the same exact problem with my dell xps 13.</li>
<li>This tool is absolutely amazing. I get 5 hours of Battery out of my Laptop while on Windows I get with the same things running about 3.5.
Appreciate your work and hope this will become standard for Linux distros.
Is the indicator cpufreq the same just with manual control?
I hope you will continue working on it to improve it further.
This tool is a game changer for Linux!! Thank you once again!! Great work!!</li>
<li>This looks great. Btw is it compatible to use with thermald?</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic awesome!</li>
</ul>
<li>BTW I am not able to catchup with your language so is there tutorail in text form on github or other site</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic OK bro I tried it 
 but when I used ur tool it gave me 5hrs of battery on regular use and without it only 4 hrs 
You Just Extended My Battery Life By 1 hr But Sometimes It Heats Up A Little High When I Use This Tool
Good Work Bro ✌️😁</li>
</ul>
<li>that's great! Got an uptime of like 1h25 minutes from like 40% to to 5% battery. Much better than tlp definitely! I guess disabling the turbo boost was what was killing it and making it flaming hot sometimes! Thanks for creating this.</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic thanks, will sure try to donate</li>
</ul>
<li>sadly my old 32 bit potato pc doesnt support it</li>
<li>Just installed a snap package on my MBA13 mid2014. Immediately I noticed the difference in CPU freq. Very good job</li>
<li>From what I can determine, this looks like a great tool. I am running the latest Ubuntu and used the installer and the "enable" option thinking, the daemon would be automatically activated on reboot. It doesn't. It would be nice if the tool would provide the option to activate (install) by default at boot, and place an icon in the task bar indicating it is active/non-active  and allow click functions to show stats (stats) or inactivate(remove), GUI functionality would make life so much easier for this tool.</li>
<li>Thanks a lot for this awesome tool! One thing opened in question. Did you ever noticed any temp rising while utilizing auto-cpufreq?</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks again!</li>

<li>Is this tool laptop only or does it work on a desktop computer?</li>
<ul>

<li>AMAZING!!!! Thaks you</li>
<li>Is it avaiable in Debian, Ubuntu and Mint repositories?</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic ok Sir thanks, i wish at future versions will be packaged for debian and some more .rpm distros, for the sake of the less experienced users. gonna check the site :)</li>
</ul>
<li>3:49 As soon as the live mode is enabled it goes from 17 hours left to 3 hours left (right side). Any explanation for that? Or was that just temporary and the right side just doesn't refresnoften enough?</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks for the reply. I'll be trying this tool out and removing TLP :)</li>
</ul>
<li>channel suggestion: everything about your linux and terminal setup and your coding environment and way of working</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic nice, I also think you would have an audience as to general advice on coding, ie how big you allow scripts to grow, how you decide to split them up, what your view of various trends in programming are, how you manage projects, eg with plugins like telescope fzf and fugitive. A lot of people are struggling and mentors have big view scores on utube. Maybe I am just seeing the 10 winners and not the 1000 that do not get a lot of views...</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic great, thanks</li>
</ul>
<li>wow ... I wonder if it can run side by side vendor control centers like tuxedo control center ... or maybe one should remove such vendor power profile software first</li>
<li>I'll check it for sure. 
Should I remove tlp AND tp_smapi for auto-cpufreq to work?</li>
<ul>

</ul>
<li>hello adnan. i installed auto-cpufreq on my x220, i mean the battery life is great now but when i'm not plugged in my i5 clocks at about 800mhz and when theres load it goes only to about 1000mhz, theres not enough power, everything takes long time to load. is there any way i could set custom scaling with this tool? btw you did a great job with this, thanks.</li>
<li>powersave governor scale my cpu max frequency to 400Mhz on battery, i5 1035g1</li>
<li>Fantastic!!</li>
<li>How do i turn off turbo boost using this tool? PLEASE help :)

Mine is showing "Warning: changing CPU turbo is not supported. skipping"</li>
<li>Really liking this tool, I'm using the new 4800u amd laptops and when watching videos the cpu does ramp up before using this tool. Now it stays a lot quieter and less warm. Was never hot but still somewhat lukewarm. Now no longer any issues. I got one question though? I currently use the snap version of the tool but kinda wanna get rid of snaps (superslow loading of apps compared to flatpak) but was wondering if the normal install also auto-updates?</li>
<li>I have cpulimit installed before discovering auto-cpufreq.  Do you recommend that I uninstall cpulimit after installing auto-cpufreq?  I am running Manjaro.  Also, will auto-cpufreq run automatically after a restart? Thanks!</li>
<li>Could u please make a package for nixos ?</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic 
Thank you

will try to package if possible.</li>

<li>Great!!! Really.</li>
<li>Works fantastic on Lenovo X1 extreme Gen 2. i-9. Thank you so much.</li>
<li>Great tool. But not working on my laptop. It says discharging even my charger plugin. And powersave mode not great for weak cpu, its lagging so much. I hope in future your tool support more gov.</li>
<li>I have HP laptop having AMD A6 with windows 10 running currently. I used linux some 6 months ago but switched back to windows because battery life was worst on linux.
Coming to question part. If I install linux back(elementary os or deepin os) and your auto cpufreq then how much hour of battery life would, I be getting?? Any idea you can tell about.
Thanks.</li>
<ul>
<li>@@AdnanHodzicso you mean to say that after installing this tool, it will behave like I am using linux on laptop and not on desktop. I was getting approx 3 hours on linux in my laptop. So will I be getting between  more than 1-2 hours MORE after installing your tool.</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks for the response...bro
I will install linux again and then will report to you about my battery life.
Really appreciate your efforts...bro
❤ from India 🇮🇳</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic have you made any detailed video on how to install your tool and  use it??

<li>Installed on my t495. Works really well so far.</li>
<li>Hi, what is the battery power utility you are using on the right hand side of the screen? Thanks</li>
<li>this might work well with the librem 5</li>
<li>It works great on my Lenovo G50-80 laptop, even better than setting governor to Conservative. 
Big thanks.</li>
<li>Very nice, Thank you</li>
<li>Solus Linux , after adding Snap it cannot run. is Reboot required?

sudo snap start /snap/bin/auto-cpufreq

returns 

error: snap "/snap/bin/auto-cpufreq" not found</li>
<ul>
<li>Late answer, but try it with "sudo snap run auto-cpufreq"</li>
</ul>
<li>Does it auto switch into powersave mode when the computer has been idle for a while.  Like during a screensaver?</li>
<li>Great application, I thought for a long time I would like to have something like this but I wasn't motivated enough to write something my own. I will test it on my laptop for sure. It would be neat if the tool checks for the amount of different processes requiring some performance. So maybe it could only turn some cores on to boost but I'm not sure if there is already control for such tweaking. Anyway good job. ^^</li>
<li>Well done!  I like that the monitor and live modes illustrate how the tool works.  For less advanced users, it addresses some of the fear of breaking something.  I recommend you estimate the battery life improvement for a common hardware setup and use case.  For example, the test could be web surfing or running Python scripts on an Ubuntu Dell XPS 13 (or X1 Carbon).  Maybe partner with benchmarking website like Phoronix? In my opinion, the endgame is switching between standardized plans: Balanced, Power Saver, and Performance--same as Windows 10--without worrying about the technical details.  Good battery optimization will also help popularize Linux!  :-)</li>
<li>I'm about to test it on my laptop.
Just for curiosity... Wich is yours laptop ?</li>
<li>good :)</li>
<li>I see that you are using i3 but you have the top bar of gnome... How this is possible?</li>
