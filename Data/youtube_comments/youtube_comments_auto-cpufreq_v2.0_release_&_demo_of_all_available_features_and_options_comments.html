<li>MashaAllah bro üí™</li>
<li>Coming here after all this time to thank you for making and updating this program. AutoCpufreq is an amazing tool that has given my laptop a second chance at life just as much as Linux Mint did, I'll be using the two for a good chunk of it's life until the laptop finally decides to run it's course. Genuinely, thank you.</li>
<ul>
<li>Most welcome and spread the word :) In meantime, please consider donating or contributing to the project! https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#donate</li>

<li>You are a hero! Thank you very much.</li>
<ul>
<li>Most welcome and spread the word :)</li>
</ul>
<li>I use auto cpu-freq on my Plex server. Why not save the watts. And I didn't want to just lock down things like turbo boost because occasionally I need that performance if some transcoding is happening.</li>
<li>You should make it more like tlp. Controling more stuff. And improve battery life further.</li>
<ul>
<li>you do realize if you don't like things done automatically you can configure them yourself using a config file? https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/?tab=readme-ov-file#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file</li>
</ul>
<li>My screen started flickering when on Powersave.  That pretty much ends entirely when on Default.  Could this utility slow things down too much and be the cause?  The laptop has 6 gigs of RAM (Samsung 4 and 2) can handle 16 so I will probably buy two sticks but am curious if anyone else has experienced it, and if maxing out RAM is useful and recommeneded.  I read the unused RAM still stores things that might be used later and makes it faster than going to the SSD drive.  If you're gonna update RAM wouldn't you just want to prepare for future needs and max it out?</li>
<ul>
<li>auto-cpufreq doesn't have anything to do with your screen flickering of RAM consumption. As it has nothing to do with either of them.</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic If I set it on Powersave it flickers, so there is cause and effect.  I'm not saying Auto-CpuFreq is the cause, but it does have that effect.</li>
</ul>
<li>Your app is great!</li>
<li>I installed Ubuntu 24 on my old 27-inch iMac (late 2013) that runs on Intel Quad Core 7 and can heat up a lot and then slow down. This was one big reason why I switched away from the MacOS but I am experiencing it is still heating a lot with Ubuntu but less frequently and so far not slowing down. So I am here to see if this tool can help reduce the heating. Let's see...</li>
<ul>
<li>@nassimabed¬† it should, if you end up having problems, report it on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic no issues at all with auto-cpufreq. I had other major issues (I am not an IT guy and new to Linux) and had to format and re-install the whole OS. Coming back today to re-install auto-cpufreq; I forgot the steps to re-watching the video... Thanks again!</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic all re-installed. I checked there's no TLP an I did systemctl stop and mask of the power profiles daemon. However I noticed somewhere that auto-cpufreq daemon will prevent bluetooth from automatically turning on at boot. This is going to be problematic for my desktop because my keyboard is wireless and I need the bluetooth on and connecting to key in the password! I am yet to setup up bluetooth (now on cabled keyboard) - will report issue if I face it.</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic So about bluetooth after reboot, I found there are threads with fixes over github - I studied them and reporting what I tried and found here: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/673  In summary it's not impossible people with desktops should not shy away from auto-cpufreq because of this.</li>
</ul>
<li>it's not working with my lenovo ideapad slim 5 with amd processor, i used to get around 6-8 hours in windows which is now around 2 hours in arch linux</li>
<ul>
<li>Please report it as a problem on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/</li>

<li>how to turn turbo boost off</li>
<ul>
<li>@@VintageBuilderr set `turbo = never` as part of auto-cpufreq config file: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#3-auto-cpufreq-config-file</li>
</ul>
<li>God bless this man haha. Amazing work. So important for all of those laptop users.</li>
<li>should the command ‚Äúlsmod [module]‚Äù be run with sudo privileges to find out,if my laptop has
the correct module installed for the correct work of the auto-cpufreq ?</li>
<li>Thank you very much, this is a life saver for my laptop.</li>

<li>does auto cpu freq support "core parking"?</li>
<ul>
<li>For now, there's a manual way to do it: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/654

and same question was asked in Discussion as part of: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues/69</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic ty for this great tool. would be nice if one could core park P-Cores and just run on the E-Cores for extra power safing.</li>
<li>Most welcome and I suggest you add this as a comment to the issue/discussion I shared above (so whoever ends up working on this takes in in consideration) and subscribe to it, so when the feature is eventually implemented you'll be first one to know.</li>

</ul>
<li>Excellent tool, thanks.  Was very much needed as a more user-friendly alternative to TLP.  I made one change from the default.  I changed the on battery governor to "ondemand" from "powersave".  Powersave frequently locked the speed at 800Mhz which made on-battery performance somewhat dismal.  The ondemand governor seems to bump the frequency quickly and drop it quickly enough after the burst is required.</li>
<ul>
<li>How did you do this?</li>
</ul>
<li>this has ben gamechanger for so long :)</li>
<li>Great tool, thank you! 
If you run your linux system in dual boot with Windows, could the tool have an impact on your Windows system too when you boot to Windows?</li>
<ul>
<li>Thanks! It's a Linux app/tool and needless to say, as such it has nothing to do with Windows.</li>
</ul>
<li>Hi Adnan, great script however I have a problem

Cpu-Autofreq detects my current setting as "powersave" and no matter what suggestion or change it makes, it will always say current: "powersave"

any suggestions?

fedora 39</li>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried overriding the governor to see if it ever switches to "performance" or even using config file? https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#2---force-governor-override

If problem persists please open an issue on Github: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Hi Adnan, thanks for your recommendation.

It seems like this did the trick and automatic switching worked, it also sticked after reboot.

This also works with the CachyOS bore kernel (great combination)


2 hours in now and my battery life has improved, normally id be sitting at 50%, I am at 70%. Really excellent script thank you for the gains in efficiency :) no noticeable impact on performance at all.

I've tried your script after fedora automatically updated my Dell bios and locked me out of undervolting which made me find your script! This has made a much bigger impact on battery life and performance so I thank you kindly.

Much appreciated!</li>

<li>Gracias</li>
<li>I live in a corrupt $hithole of a country that has power outages every single day.
For someone like me, this amazing tool you've created is not just a "convenient" functionality, but an absolute necessity as I'm studying Software Engineering.
With auto-cpufreq I actually have a fighting chance to study longer, and  have a better life somewhere else.</li>
<ul>
<li>Glad to hear auto-cpufreq has such positive impact on you! Thank you for sharing this comment, as it can only serve as additional motivation in its further development.</li>
<li>Thanks again! ü§òüòéü§ò@@AdnanHodzic</li>
<li>Just add, I would also encourage you to consider doing a code contributions to the project. As getting involved with open source is one of the best ways to learn software engineering: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#code-contribution@@dezly-macauley</li>
</ul>
<li>How to measure the effect of this program in increasing battery life?</li>
<ul>
<li>By observing battery life. If you're using GNOME as your desktop environment, go to Settings > Power which has nice indicator how many hours you have left when you're on battery.

Another useful one is GNOME Power Statistics.</li>

<li>Hvala Adnane, pozdrav iz Miami-a</li>
<ul>
<li>nema na cemu :)</li>
</ul>
<li>one question, does it work with power profiles daemon ? it will be cool to change the profiles of cpu with the power profiles daemon direcly from gnome quick center.</li>
<ul>
<li>auto-cpufreq renders power profiles redundant. Because it does it everything automatically for you: https://twitter.com/fooctrl/status/1467469508373884933?t=YgpGcYJF9EYtwAaYAf_Sjw&s=19</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic  so what u mean its depending on what my GPU is doing, it will increase the performance or vice versa, for the CPU and the gpu ? like on 2 Firefox tabs will be on power saver, and when i open a game it will change automatically to performance mode ?</li>
<li>@@thericermoon yes, something like that but based on many more factors. Of course, if you wish you can always override it yourself. Would suggest you read project ReadMe for more info https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq or watch first/initial video where went in more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkYRpVEEIlg</li>

<li>Thanks. This is just sets cpu frequencys and governors . When i rendering a video or building a project or running stress test on my laptop does not throttling. This is too dangerous. How can i enable throttling on Debian 12?</li>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#configuring-auto-cpufreq</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks for answer. I know this is not the place to talk about this. Maybe you can help me. The app is realy good. But the answer to my question is not in the link. I already using your auto-cpufreq and i know how it is work. I using app with config file. I setted 2.7ghz max frequancy for charger and selected conservative govarnor. I setted 2 ghz max frequancy for battery and selected conservative governor. So far everythink is normal. When i start a render with charge cpu is working 2.7 ghz all rendering time and it reaches 98¬∞. Why cpu did not throttle? I want when cpu reached 85¬∞ automatic decrace max frequancy. This app's just changing my frequancy and governor when i use my device with battery. I think my question's aswer is not here?ü§î</li>
<li>@@mfa9306If you have an issue please report in on: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
</ul>
<li>I have the issue that I installed it some time ago, and I was having issues. So I've tried reinstalling it and such, but it seems like my installation is corrupt and I can't even do a clean install. If I try to delete my cloned directory"rm -rf auto-cpufreq" it tells me permission denied.
I've tried listing the services "sudo systemctrl list-units --state running | grep cpu" with no result.  However "ps ax | grep 1002715" does return once instance. But I can't seem to kill that process.

I'm kinda stuck here, it's a pain working on the laptop because sometimes the PC just freezes, probably due to the CPU clock going into chill-mode.</li>

<li>I just installed this on my rog ally gaming handheld and it‚Äôs great , gaming performance seems smoother , I had to disable pstates but pstates seems bugged on Linux for amd and the cpu was using high power and wattage for no reason ? So thanks for this great software</li>
<li>Hello I have been having issues with my handheld rog ally with amd z1e cpu using far to much power and frequency to high doing low tasks , but it is using pstates , can auto frequency control pstates as well or do I need to disable pstates ? I know the docs say if there are issues to disable it , I just wanted to know if it will auto select best pstate for the tasks that‚Äôs needed</li>
<ul>
<li>Please refer to: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting if the problem persists, feel free to open the issue: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/issues</li>
</ul>
<li>Thanks. Is there a way to make the numbers refresh much quicker? Like every 1 second?
I'm looking for an app (or apps) that can monitor cpu thread usage, temp, hdd ssd temp, and if possible, Intel igpu usage and temp.
I need to see if a single cpu thread is maxing out or not.</li>
<li>Auto cpu Freq+ TLP is good or bad ...can we use together?</li>
<ul>
<li>Bad, this is mentioned in Readme: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq#why-do-i-need-auto-cpufreq and if TLP is detected by auto-cpufreq even a message will be printed out to disable/remove it.</li>
</ul>
<li>I watch on video that "intel_pstate" is loaded as driver, but the oficial documentation recommends "acpi cpufreq". The newer versions of auto-cpufreq are playing nice with "intel_pstate"?</li>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely, Troubleshooting part of ReadMe suggests switching between these 2 if you issues, but usually it should work just fine: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#troubleshooting</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Thanks</li>
</ul>
<li>yet to get the GUI to work because of my terminal being screwy but the live mode an such still works so XD</li>
<li>Could you make a video for usage only? Dank u.
Many people want to know what it does and are unable to understand how.
Diest version of this video in 2 minutes would be appreciated by a lot of laptop users.
Usages for some computers: high performance laptop, silent desktop, long battery life, etc.</li>
<ul>
<li>Hey, just so I understand. You're asking to create a video that explains how auto-cpufreq works/could work in different scenarios, i.e: high performance laptop, silent desktop, long battery life. Excluding what was described as part from 5:14 to 11:55?</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic Yes, this video is for the programmer. Most of the people are happy to watch a Kiosk vending machine instruction. It only tells where to put the money and which button to press. Gnome new desktop has a neat switch for CPU performance settings, just two clicks, then it‚Äôs done. All the children need a simple model to understand.</li>
<li>‚Äã@@blackjack8957 right, I thought most of this stuff is covered as part of README: https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/#1-power_helperpy-script-snap-package-install-only or in particular: https://twitter.com/fooctrl/status/1467469508373884933

IMO Gnome performance settings are very basic, and I literally explain what's wrong with *it* and all other tools out there in beginning of this video: https://youtu.be/SPGpkZ0AZVU?si=TIljTupy5dGDng7b&t=30. That is they require you to manually "flip" the switch to change between performance governors and with auto-cpufreq you don't have to do any of this, it does all of it automatically for you based of various criteria, like CPU load, is the computer charging or not, core temperature and etc ..

Regardless, since I see a lot of questions like this one in comments, if you or the community get a list of questions that I could answer or clarify some things briefly, I wouldn't mind creating a new video/it could even be shorts video. Let me know!</li>
<li>@@AdnanHodzic The short video idea 'reclaim van de automaat', set and run 2 laptops, one with auto-cpufreq and another without it.
Fast forward and one without it runs out of battery. Then you show up wearing jump suits and type ‚Äòsudo auto-cpufreq --install‚Äô.
There would be something short and catchy words, ‚ÄòGet it, see it yourself.‚Äô or ‚ÄòThis is easy as one, two, three.‚Äô
Hope a lot of users try this app and implemented into Debian official packages.</li>
<li>@@blackjack8957 happy to report that there's already a Debian RFP: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1053294 :)</li>
